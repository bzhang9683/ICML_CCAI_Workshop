No specific scientific proof but it appears that high water temps in creek is likely reducing survival of salmon fry, based on observations of Fish and Wildlife staff for the last several years. This is Likely happening in all creeks, as they have observed decreases in returns in all creeks island wide.Ocean water temps have been significantly warmer- this is impacting herring migratory behavior.  If you need additional backup, Fish and Wildlife can produce that from research done previously to demonstrate the changes in herring behavior in recent years. Water temperatures are impacting an early algal bloom which is impacting herring spawning behavior. Dive fisheries are being impacted by water temps increasing the length of toxic algal blooms, resulting in high PST level readings. This impacts the commercial Geoduck fishery and then subsistence harvest for all other shellfish. Low water in lakes is reducing available water for hydro generation, resulting in the tribe relying on diesel generation for the foreseeable future. Reduced snowpack, results in low spring recharge in hydrological systems, the result is lower lake and stream levels at the beginning of the season, which become more critically low as the drier summer progresses. This low water and warmer temperatures may be contributing to low salmon fry survival as well. Forest Health Low water levels and low rainfall, have increased the stressors on evergreen species, allowing pests such as spruce aphids to cause widespread ill health, and gradual die-off region wide.Berry bushes had high amounts berries due to the sunshine, but many late season berries were very dry and shriveled, reflecting how dry conditions were. Salmon berries were ready for harvesting in late May which was earlier than normal and we were harvesting still in August. Evergreen trees are losing their foliage.Many of the evergreen ferns that typically grow on the roadsides have been heavily impacted by low water conditions, turning brown and dying early.Temperate late fall weather has allowed an entire extra flowering cycle of some invasive species, such as, Orange Hawkweed, Tansy Ragwort, Fall Dandelion and sow thistle. Wildlife impactsHummingbirds have been known to stay year round instead of migrating south.Robins and Flickers have been returning earlier, as early as February instead of late March or early April.The increasing humpback whale population is a factor of climate change.  Before 15 years ago there were no known overwintering humpback whales in Southeast Alaska.  In the present time we can document humpbacks in AIR waters year round.  This may be the Northern most Southern overwintering ground.  Back in the day humpbacks would return to Hawaii or Mexico for winter.  Now the warmer oceans are more productive further north so the whales do not need to follow food all the way to Hawaii.The increased abundance of deer on Walden Pt Rd in early spring is contributed to climate change.  The warming temps earlier in the year is causing alder to bud out earlier.  The road systems are great places for alder to reach to the sun.

Soil moisture at the end of winter was so little that the grasses and forbs on the uplands (away from the river) never greened up -- they never broke winter dormancy. Since we acquired our 280 acres at the beginning of 1995, we had never before seen a monsoon season (typically mid-July to mid-September) when we did not receive plenty of rain to turn the pastures bright green. However, the monsoon season is almost over and the upland grasses and forbs remain dormant -- we've had a few storms that dropped up to 1/4 inch of rain but the storms were separated by enough time that the soil never accumulated enough moisture for the grasses and forbs to break dormancy. In short, 11 months into the water year, and the upland grasses and forbs have not greened at all (except in some small locations where rocks concentrated the rainfall in the soil). As a plant ecologist, I'm left wondering whether most of the perennial grasses can survive a year and a half of dormancy until next spring (assuming they never break dormancy this year). Also wondering that if a strong storm does come that breaks their dormancy at the end of this ""growing season"", will that be good or actually hurt the long-term survival of the perennial grasses by them using their root reserves to begin growth while there is too little growing season left to replenish the reserves of nutrients in their roots.The drought does appear to be killing off some unpalatable shrubs: almost all of the broom snakeweed (a native) appears to be dead, as does much or most of the black sagebrush (also a native). For many years I have wondered why those shrubs were not larger components of the ecosystem on our property, given their propensity to encroach over time when fire is not present in the grassland. Now I hypothesize that occasional severe droughts have been the mechanism that kept our pastures heavily dominated by native perennial grasses.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Slick Rock 1.3 N on 8/31/2018",Plants & Wildlife,"San Miguel County, CO",

Ground temps at the same depths are 76°F and 76°F. Soil moisture education note: Barring a torrential downpour resulting in standing field water, the soil moisture levels at 3 & 5 inches in the station’s Buckhall clay will lag rainfall by 12 - 30 hours due to the fescue moisture uptake and slow percolation in the clay soil. Levels at 8 & 16 inches are relatively stable.A total of 0.35 inch of precipitation recorded in the past seven days since the last Condition Monitoring Report was submitted. Weekly evapotranspiration (ETo) total was 0.95 inch resulting in a 0.60 inch ground moisture deficit.As is typical of summer thunderstorm activity, rainfall amounts are highly variable within short distances. For example, on Tuesday, FoxMill Station recorded an inconsequential ¼ inch of rain while two other stations a mere 5 and 7½ miles north-northwesterly, also with NIST-certified sensors, reported 1¼ and 1½ inch of rain from the same line of cells. Nevertheless, the weekly rainfall did not exceed the evapotranspiration so everyone ended up with yet another weekly moisture deficit. The area’s row crops are most assuredly showing drought stress of late.  Barley and wheat yields were low and had very low test weights. Low harvested-grain test weights (nutrient density) are indicative of crops which have endured stress during the grain fill period…that “stress” can be environmental as well as insect or disease related. This year was a double whammy, multiple flooding rains early in the growing season with uncharacteristically low temps followed by drought stress during the critical seed-fill period. Pastures are also showing the impact of this extended dry weather and the second cuttings of hay have produced reduced yields. The region’s second-cutting hay crop could be characterized as exhibiting low quality (high fiber/reduced nutrients) and quantity. The local waterways have predictably low water levels and residential lawn watering is a must to keep the grass from going dormant. That could change quickly this coming week. The NWS has issued an area-wide flash flood watch starting this morning at 1100 hours, possible rainfall amounts of 2 - 4 inches. Additionally, the weekly composite model predicts daily afternoon thunderstorms of a half inch or more through next Saturday’s Condition Monitoring Report. We’ll see how that pans out when next Saturday’s report is published.This morning’s weighted soil-moisture readings puts us in the “Moderately Dry” range as defined by CoCoRaHS.July totals to date: Precip 0.35 inch; ETo 3.12 inches resulting in a monthly ground moisture deficit of 2.77 inches at FoxMill which correlates nicely (high R^2) with the observed soil moisture readings after accounting for the last precipitation type, weighted rate of fall, amount, duration, surface water runoff, ground temperatures, ETo and the previous 30 day rolling measured data. Yearly moisture through this morning: Precip 29.76 inches, ETo 18.07 inches, resulting in a surfeit of 11.69 inches.FoxMill Weather Station (VA-PW-13) provides detailed ground moisture information (including evapotranspiration plus multi-depth soil temperature and moisture readings) on a *daily* basis in the CoCoRaHS Daily Precipitation Report ”Observation Notes"" section which is updated at 6 a.m. by the duty observer.Data reported by: observer2 (ampersat) foxmill.us at FoxMill Weather Station, Saturday, 21 July 2018.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Manassas 5.3 SE on 7/21/2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","Prince William County, VA",

45193,Texas beef producers ought to be prepared in case drought persists,07/11/2018,07/08/2018, ,"Texas beef producers ought to plan to downsize their herds if drought continued, according to Dr. Jason Banta, AgriLife Extension beef cattle specialist.  The shortage of forage and hay will be problematic, meaning that producers might save money by whittling the herd down.  Producers must be careful not to overgraze pastures.  Cool temperatures were also part of the problem.  Winter lasted longer than usual, with a cool spring making the hay crop smaller than normal.  The second cutting was similarly below normal in quantity and quality, due to drought.

The high temperatures continued until just recently (July 28). We were also still fairly dry from low rain in 2017.  Our fescue/bermuda/clover pasture was dried up and gone by the second week in June and we started feeding hay we had left over from the winter at a rate of two bales a day. By the first of July, that hay was gone and we bought two loads of mixed grass round bales for $50/bale delivered.  We have fed hay daily and are still feeding hay.  By July 25, we were getting close to running out of hay again and started a search for more hay. None of our regular sources was able to find hay, and our internet/Facebook search could not locate any hay for sale, even in adjoining states and as far away as Nebraska. The only hay we could find was $85/bale plus hauling. After being completely out of hay for almost a week, we located mixed grass round bales within 150 miles of us that will be delivered August 1st at a cost of $80/bale delivered.  This is only two loads (68 bales), so we will be out of hay again in three weeks.  The temperatures are cooler as of two days ago, and we received one inch of rain total in the last two days, so we have hope that maybe the rain will start now.  But we have no hay for the winter, and there will be no hay available unless the weather holds long enough for it to grow from nothing.  We are paying $80/bale and more IF we can find hay at all, and this may continue until next spring.

Snakes and gators are still on the move for new habitat. Lots of crawls across our dirt roads.Shrimp season is being delayed until mid to late June due to the winter kill of shrimp and the cold water delay of the incoming spawning shrimp (brown shrimp). They are hoping for a heavy spawn, which will give a heavier white shrimp catch later in the summer. Last year it opened in early April.On May 8, Daufuskie Island had the earliest logger head turtle nest in the state of S.C. Things are shaping up to be a very busy nesting season. The sand has built up nicely on the beach. The downside: I’ve noticed that the armadillos are really starting to prowl the beach looking for those nests. A real problem that is.

Wildflower mass bloom was restricted to one species for one week, and other species are only blooming as scattered individuals.  Since we didn't have a winter, and now have no snow pack or snow melt, it follows that our spring is so diminished as well.  But it's worse than that because in addition to no moisture from the previous season, this season as well has been incredibly dry and windy with many days of single digit humidity. This coupled with no precipitation has stressed, kept dormant or outright killed many plants and animals.  This drought is also stressing and hurting people as well. Dry eyes, nose and throat and dehydration exacerbates allergies and other health issues, making people tired, stressed and irritable.  Wind storms with blowing sand and dust have diminished outdoor recreation as well, making it difficult and painful.  Spring wildflower displays, which usually attract many people to the outdoors and are a hallmark of the state, have been greatly diminished, shortened, or failed this year.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Placitas 3.8 ENE on 4/30/2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Relief, Response & Restrictions, Society & Public Health, Tourism & Recreation","Sandoval County, NM",

When I came back the ground was still showing signs of moisture at the surface from a recent storm, my wife said we had 2.5 inches,  but it was a very cold snow so it did not contain a lot of moisture. I hope at least .10 inches maybe . The moisture disappeared a couple days later when we had high winds with very low humidity's then we had some more snow about 2.4 inches that its liquid equivalent was .11 inches and the soil looks moist again and is tacky, but we are going to have strong winds with low humidity's again that is going to dry the soil out again . Also while I was gone, we had another brush fire about 4 miles due west of us with strong westerly winds I believe just before the snow we had before I got back causing me to come back 3 days early . The wife thought she heard it was 32 to 38 acres . I have not had a chance to check the depth of the soil moisture but just recently had to bury a dove, that appeared to have froze to death, with a Maddox because of frozen ground . I buried it on the west, sunny, side of my pines and could only get 6"" to 7"" deep but what I saw looked moist and frozen, hard to tell . The birds are eating even less so I keep cutting back . The bird baths have been mostly frozen and have had trouble freeing them up . One , a big stainless steel bowl , has been the easiest and can always free it of ice but the black satellite dish, 4' off the ground , has been harder than normal to free it of ice . I have seen less blue jays maybe a couple from time to time . The feeders are 7' off the ground to help keep the deer out of them, but they get what is spilled by the birds so I fill at a minimum twice daily . I can still tell the deer are almost here every night . They trigger our motion lights plus I see there hoof prints . They try to get the water before it's to frozen plus I have seen them munching on our lilac stem . The rabbits are the most destructive, we have had to chicken wire all our smaller trees because they kept mowing them to the ground . Now some have grown 5' to 6' over 3 years , mostly ash trees , plus we have a lot less rabbits . The evergreens are looking decent especially the ones that got watered then shortly after we got 2 somewhat decent snow's . The buds on the deciduous trees are smaller/tighter but still okay and their stems are still flexible . We still have some of the drifts left from a couple months ago, in the shaded area that now is all white again from the recent snows . I have been having to pick up more tumbleweeds, knap weed and Russian thistle, and pull them out of the upright junipers to minimize fire danger. Hopefully the winds start backing off. Looking forward to spring and hopeful moisture . Need some pounding thunderstorms. It was 6 degrees this A.M. so had better get out to feed birds and break up the ice, at least it's sunny. We are still going through more wood and propane, it's half gone almost again, the propane . The propane company was very busy the last time and it took a while for them to get to us, almost a month .

This pond was dipped out this winter, but the dam was never broken and little water was lost. It barely had enough water to sustain 15 head of cattle last summer from June thru September and there is no way we could take cattle there this year. In Daviess County, the 2017 calendar year closed out 8.69 inches below normal rainfall. So far in 2018 we have received 6.69 (as of June 4); normal rainfall by this time is 14.68 (source: CoCoRahs and NOAA). There are many ponds in the county that look like this or worse and producers are starting to sell large quantities of livestock due to the combination of lack of hay/pasture and lack of water. I have had several reports of wells quitting already. Much of the winter wheat failed this spring due to lack of moisture. Corn is rolled throughout most of the county and soybeans are taking longer than normal to emerge and inconsistent in their emergence. Rainfall was short during the 2017 growing season as well and that caused a great shortage of hay, with some producers reporting a 50% loss. Due to the continued lack of rainfall in 2017, livestock producers starting feeding hay earlier than normal in the fall and longer than normal this spring. This has led to a massive search for hay, and the cost of hay has escalated tremendously. Pastures have very little undergrowth and produced seed heads much earlier than normal, leaving it poorer quality.

Before that we had more of a winter season from Nov. through Feb./Mar.

We had two brief snowstorms in northern NM this month, on Dec. 6th/7th and on Dec. 22nd.  The high northern peaks were dusted with snow on these two occasions, and promptly melted off completely the next day on both occasions.  So we have no snowpack in northern NM which is going to greatly impact our water supply and quality.  Winter sports are obviously impacted as well, skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and all the attendant activities that go along with snow, snow removal, and tourism. People continue to suffer with allergies and dry mucous membranes, fatigue, and other drought related impacts to physical health.

Our nearest post office is Paskenta, CA.  Since our first rainfall on November 8, 2017 we have received 6.25"" of rain.  Our average for the year is around 22"". We have approximately 45 days remaining in our rainy season.        Our ranch consists of 6500 acres and has the carrying capacity, on a normal year, of 500 fall pairs for the grazing season, which consists of the months from November through mid May.  This provides 180 day season multiplied by 500 pairs equals 90,000 animal grazing days.      Our grass is O.K. at best.  To clarify, the quality is good, quantity is poor.  The rain has waited until the last possible day to arrive on every occasion thus far meaning we have had little rain, but it has arrived at just the right time to keep us going.       The drought is affecting our operation in multiple ways.      1. The first impact is our carrying capacity.   November 15 we brought in 300 fall pairs.  This is a little over half of what should have been brought in.  March 10 we brought in another 100 fall pairs and 60 spring calving cows.  This works out to: 300 pairs multiplied by 180 days equals 54,000 animal grazing days plus 100 pairs and 60 bred cows multiplied by only 60 days equals 9,600 animal grazing days for a total of 63,600 animal grazing days.  This is a 30% loss in carrying capacity.2. Rain  Runoff.  We depend on rain runoff to recharge stock ponds and to provide stream flow in seasonal creeks to provide drinking water.  We have been hauling water to one group of cows for 3 weeks.  The others will be fine for this year.3. Calf market weights.  We are projecting our market calves to be 40-70 pounds lighter due to lack of available feed and also having to sell animals sooner.  4. The greatest impact of 2017-2018 drought, in my opinion,  will be fall of 2018.  We have not received any runoff to recharge our stock ponds.  This will not allow us to graze cattle until we receive significant rain which will shorten our cattle grazing days for a second consecutive year.      The drought is really spotty in northern California.  Conditions change drastically within 30 miles of our operation; some for the better, most for the worst.       To summarize, to graze one cow for one day is $1.33  We will lose 26,400 animal grazing days this season for a loss of $35,112.  Add 400 fall pairs, which will yield 300 calves to sell weighing 560 pounds (last years average was 600 pounds) for a price of $1.50/lb equals $840.00 ($900.00 using last years weights) for a loss of $60.00 per calf multiplied by 300 equals $18,000 loss.  2018-2019 presents other potential losses with less animal grazing days.  There is a very good possibility we will not have any cattle until January 1, 2019, due to stock pond recharge,  which will be a 45-day loss of days.  45 days multiplied by 500 pairs equals 22,500 animal grazing days multiplied by $1.33 for a loss of $29,925.  This puts our total financial loss to $83,037.00, not counting losses from conception issues, lack of feed for replacements, lack of yield in hay production, etc...From Tehama County, California, on April 3, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Tehama County, CA, Paskenta, CA",

Topsoil moisture was nonexistent; the forage was very dry with little feed value in it; and the fall green up never occurred, according to Doug Christensen, a Monticello-based director of the federal Farm Services Agency.

Also fall seeded perennials in some cases germinated then died or didn’t germinate until mid to late October, leaving them pretty immature going into the winter.

The Hungarian partridge harvest of 19 birds was equivalent to the 2018 total, but was well below the long-term average.  Scott Hemmer, a biologist in the Havre area and manager of the station stated, “The continued lower upland bird numbers is likely due to the impact of drought conditions in the summer of 2017 along with the hard winter of 2017-18.

I'm a soil scientist and have been digging holes this month in powder dry soils (except in some moisture-retentive wetland settings).

I have kept double records this year to compare the accuracy of my old gauge and it seems to overstate the rainfall by about 9.33 % as compared to my ""official"" rain gauge. So, I assume my historical records are overstated similarly.  That being said, we are accustom to a ""summer drought"" that benefits my particular type of agriculture which is forage, turf and covercrop seed production.Even so, the large amount of accumulated moisture through the year yielded a lot of vegetative growth that has since dried yielding a lot of tinder in the wild areas and resulting a many and large wild fires. Which, in turn, results in main days of less that healthy air conditions, property destruction and loss of forested lands.  In my area visibility has been reduced to less than 1 mile on several days and often to less than 2 miles.The majority of our farm acres are planted in the fall so the very dry ground has required more horsepower to prepare and produced a lot of dust.

Areas of soybean fields are showing similar stress from dryness. In the areas of the fields that do not show signs of stress the corn and soybean plants appear healthy and still have a dark green color. Water flow in small creeks and streams has stopped or slowed to a trickle. Medium-size creeks and streams still have some water flow, but large areas of the creek bed are exposed due to the low volume of flow. Field tiles have very little flow and some with relatively small drainage areas have completely stopped. Overall the water flow in creeks, streams and drainage tiles is below to much below what is typical for early September.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #New Windsor 2.0 N on 9/4/2017","Agriculture, Water Supply & Quality","Henry County, IL",

Some of the cattle may be sent to a feedlot during the winter, but that may require the couple to take second jobs to bear the extra expense.

We utilize National Grasslands, which has been the only good grazing so far this year, but that too is fast being used up due to the lack of rainfall so far.  The recent temperatures in the 90s to 100 are fast taking a toll on the forage still green. Many warm season pastures are showing very reduced growth and even dormant appearing due to the dry conditions.  Hay crops are extremely reduced due to late frosts and no runoff from the snow we had over winter. Most hay fields are being patched cut as there is no windrow to be had on upland areas of fields. Here, almost all grain crops are being cut for hay as the heads are not filling and they are the only green forage around. We and others have planted millet to see if it can provide added feed, but much of it has not sprouted as the ground is too dry and it has not rained. Hay yields vary, but much grain is acres per bale; not bales per acre. Many of our neighbors have had problems cutting and baling due to the fire danger present now.

We have experienced unprecedented drought and heat since late June 2017.  Our cattle have not had green grass for over 60 days.  We typically put up enough hay for our operation but have had to purchase supplemental hay and straw this year.  We have two pastures that have run out of water, so we have had to use fall pasture.  We desperately need this pasture for fall and winter grazing, but since it has water the cattle had to come to it 45 days early.  This will force us to either sell bred cows or buy additional supplemental hay.  In addition to pastures being without water, the quality of the grass has been in decline.  We did have a good start to the grass with moisture in May and June but it cured early, is powder dry, and has had no green re-growth for over 90 days since there has been no measurable precipitation.  Montana is forecast to receive widespread rain Sept. 13-15.  To date, Sept. 14, 2017, we have received intermittent sprinkles, which have barely dampened the ground.  Typically we keep 100 calves to choose 60-70 replacement heifer calves from and run the rest as yearlings.  This year, due to the drought, we will sell every calf and cull the cow herd deeply.

Water levels fell after a 20-year wet cycle drew to a close, exposing more land on an island where thousands of pelicans breed and nest.  Drought also drove down the populations of some invasive plants, such as Kentucky bluegrass and smooth brome.  The dry weather also allowed for more progress on projects with private landowners like fencing projects. The Bismarck Tribune (N.D.), Nov. 28, 2017Dry conditions at the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge have allowed water levels to recede, revealing more of the main nesting island, according to Neil Shook, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist and refuge manager.  For years, wet weather caused the lake level to increase, submerging about half, or 12 acres, of the main island, but the recent dryness has allowed the birds more room.  The pelicans usually begin arriving in North Dakota in April and remain through September, rearing their young and feeding at small prairie ponds.

40864,"Cattle sales, crop loss near Herreid, South Dakota",07/10/2017,06/07/2017,06/29/2017,"We farm and ranch 7 miles west of Herreid, South Dakota and we have wheat, soybeans and corn crops and also run around 200 head of cows with calves on the side. The crops were planted on time but due to no moisture this spring in our area, some of the crops came up, but look bad and other crops haven't even come up and when we have dug down in the ground, the seed has turned black. There will be no crop! We are hoping for rain soon so we can go back into those fields and plant some sort of feed source for our cattle. Due to the dry conditions, for the past month, we have been sorting through our herd and picking off cow/calf pairs to sell due to the lack of grass for the summer. We had a very hard winter and our feed supply is very low and with no corn crop, we will be looking for some type of feed for the cows or we are considering sending our cows away for the winter, just so we can keep the younger portion of our herd. My husband and I have been married for close to 31 years this fall and we went through one drought in 2006 and it was one of the hardest things we have gone through, and especially for me. We started our own herd by buying some registered Simmental cows and most of our herd is home raised, and yes, this old farm lady gets quite attached to her cows. In 2006, we had to sell 75 pairs and I can still remember the day the semis came into the yard to take those mama cows and their babies to the sales barn. I cried and cried! Now, we are experiencing the same thing! We have sold 20 pairs so far and will be selling 18 more pairs tomorrow. Yes, I always watch our animals in the sale ring and yes, I'm not ashamed to say, the tears flow down my face as they sell as this is a hard situation as it isn't something we have done wrong, but God and Mother Nature at work.  We have seen news stories from Aberdeen, SD and Bismarck, ND where the trucks and trailers are lined up for a long distance as they wait to drop off their pairs at the local sales barn. I have a feeling it will be happening in our local sales barns this week also!  The crops and cattle is the livelihood for these farmers and ranchers and some have been in the business for years and others are just beginning. What a hardship this will be for all farmers and ranchers as not only do they not have a crop for market, they will have no cattle to sell when they usually do to pay off the operating loans, etc. People in our country need to realize that these farmers and ranchers who bust their you know what day after day, is what keeps food on their tables. It does not magically appear at the grocery stores!  The sad part is that our son, who is 20 years old, just graduated from college with an Agronomy degree and he plans to work for awhile, which he is doing, but in the future, he would like to take over the family farm and he would be the 4th generation to run this operation. This situation is scaring him as he realizes how quickly things can go the other way. We need more of these family farms and ranches instead of the big operations as this is what life is all about to give the legacy down to the next generation. My husband and I just want the government, people, etc. to know what our situations are as every day is full of work and worry. There have been many sleepless night staying up and talking and figuring out what we are going to do as this was not the plan for this year. Yes, we chose this as our job, but why is it when other states have a storm disaster or whatever, it is immediately blown out of proportion by the media, but ""never"" do we hear anything about when something like this happens in the Dakotas. This is not just South Dakota it is affecting North Dakota also!From Herreid, South Dakota on June 7, 2017","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Society & Public Health","Campbell County, SD, Herreid, SD",

This will be a great economic burden to us. We are already planning to sell them 4-6 weeks earlier than usual, because there is no grass left for them. We have had to fence out dams/ponds because cattle were getting stuck in the mud. Our local water source, West River Lyman Jones Water, has issued water bans for our area - our county commissioners have issued a burn ban because of the high risk of fire, and the large number of fires. We get lightning, but no rain. Not only is this continuous drought affecting the livestock, but also wildlife, our economy, and our mental health! Along with the extremely minimal rainfall we had in June and July, we also experienced a record number of days in which the temperature was over 100 degrees - one entire week, it reached 108 or above every single day! It actually felt relief when it went back down to just 100 degrees the next two weeks!

Multiple producers have commented that they may not get a hay crop at all this year.  Other farmers have made the decision to hay wheat as it has been adjusted out and will not make a grain crop.  I have tested some wheat samples for nitrates and they were present, but the producers have decided to go ahead and hay it and then test nitrates after it is baled.  There was very little runoff this spring and water quality concerns are more prevalent with producers testing surface water. Many samples are in excess of 3000 ppm TDS, which is the threshold for sending samples to a lab to determine if sulfates are an issue.  Some producers have mentioned decreased grazing due to decreased forage.

We use one of our summer pasture fields to finish up breeding. We were unable to use this field for the 30 days. We had to move our cows out 15 days early due to the drought. Our water source was nearly dry and the cows had to go into mud to get to water. This piece of land is along the mountain front and the springs went dry before July 14. Our hay field produced 30 tons and on a good year it would have produced 100+ ton. Our winter pasture fields are extremely dry and barren. A high wind will break what grass that did grow right off. The trees in our shelter belt are dying especially since we had little to no rain last year and the same this year. We will have to cut down at least 50 trees which have died from this ongoing drought. Due to the lack of moisture, we had to feed 250 ton of extra hay last winter (usually, if our winter pasture has grazing we only feed 250 ton).

According to Glasgow National Weather Service-- we have had the driest April-June precipitation on record and driest June on record. We have harvested 90% less hay than average. Our winter wheat is half the height of average, the heads are half the size, and we will be harvesting 3-4 weeks ahead of average. Our spring crops we planted are stunted (if they even emerged, which many fields only had partial emergence). Spring wheat heads that are filling have very small kernels. We have moved cows to late summer/fall pastures 2 months earlier than normal to access grass and other sources of water. We are going to be drilling an additional stock water well and pipelining water to other areas for our cattle to access. Estimation of cost around $60,000 for completion. We have been rebuilding old fence and building new fence to access old CRP ground that we lease.CRP hay that is there is burning up and losing quality rapidly. We have had 90+ degrees since July 2 and the extended forecast shows continued heat trend. We are also volunteer firefighters for our county. We have a county-sponsored pickup with water tank unit. We are very worried about the fire season with CRP haying opening on July 16 (especially with the forecasted temp of 101*).  I was also at a meeting last night in Glasgow, MT with MT Representative Greg Gianforte. I was there with 12 other producers representing 8 counties in NE MT that are in the drought zone. Here are some of the reports that were given last night: -One rancher in Phillips county said that using past data and statistics that he keeps on his livestock, that his cows are losing 2.5 lbs of weight a day due to not having quality feed (that was the measurement on June 18 when nutrition of forage should be at its peak).  He normally doesn't have to supplement his cows until late August, but he started already 3 weeks ago, and this is an expensive additional cost.-One ag-related business estimates they will lose $30M through the rest of this year in lost equipment sales, lost repairs, and they may have to lay off some of their 58 technicians because there isn't enough work to keep the mechanics and technicians busy for 40  hours a week. -No one in the room has had to let go farm/ranch hired hands, but several know neighbors who have done so already.-One young rancher near Poplar has only been doing this for 5 years, and just bought their own land this year.  He will have no income this year from farming, maybe a little bit from ranching.-Irrigators are also seeing issues with things drying out quickly.  It will be more expensive paying the power bills for the pivot irrigators than what they'll get in crop returns.  -A rancher stated that usually at this time of year he has 900 lb yearlings.  This year they are 800 lbs due to the lack of forage, and at the current price of feeder cattle (hugely volatile, from $1.40/lb to $1.60/lb) that is a large loss on thousands of cattle.  ​-One last comment, not from this meeting but from a former Valley County Sheriff.  Last year he cut 330 round bales of hay.  This year he got 22. In addition to this, I have heard several people say they will not be hiring custom harvest crews because of the lack of crops (loss of income for those crews). Many businesses are already feeling the effect of the drought--we aren't buying equipment and vehicles, getting things serviced in town, going out to supper, buying new furniture, shopping, traveling to larger towns like Miles City, Billings, etc. to shop, and more.From Richland County, Montana, on July 9, 2017","Agriculture, Business & Industry, Fire, Water Supply & Quality","Custer County, MT, Daniels County, MT, Dawson County, MT, Fallon County, MT, Garfield County, MT, McCone County, MT, Petroleum County, MT, Phillips County, MT, Powder River County, MT, Prairie County, MT, Richland County, MT, Roosevelt County, MT, Rosebud County, MT, Sheridan County, MT, Valley County, MT",

When there is inadequate moisture during the months of April, May and June, forage production is seriously affected.The reduction of forage production on rangeland is the same across all the counties I have done rangeland evaluations.

Since the Xmas blizzard in 2016, we have received 3 measurable rains.  One was .30"" in early May, another .33"" in late May, and we recently received less than 1"" of rainfall throughout the system on June 12-13.   Neighbors within 15-mile radius caught slightly more rain.I have not seen our pastures in such poor conditions in June.  This is an unusually poor year because of the spring--we had an early thaw but also had repeated frosts into May.  By the time we reached the growing season in May, the moisture was completely depleted.   Grass has been turning brown since late April.  Even in pastures with an abundance of carry-over grass, the only places that remain green are the draws, and they are dying as well.  Our hayfields are not worth cutting, and livestock have been turned out on a few of them.  Several dams are dry, and the others are holding poor quality water.  We are using an above-ground water line to allow us to utilize one pasture.  In order to utilize another, we may have to haul water daily to the livestock.  Livestock from this area are being liquidated, and it appears this will continue.  Ranchers are purchasing failed wheat fields (at a high price) in an attempt to acquire winter feed.Our crops were all planted timely due to not having any rain delays.  This is, without a doubt, the poorest crop we've ever had in mid-June.

We had small amounts of rain on two different days for a total of 0.31”.  While it was a very small amount rain on one of those days, it proved to be very timely.  Late Wednesday afternoon, there was a small brush fire in the woods about one to two tenths of a mile down the hill directly behind our house.  Thankfully a neighbor saw the smoke and called the fire department before the fire had a chance to spread very far.  As it was about a half hour before sunset, the wind had substantially subsided from what it had been earlier in the day. The ground was still a little wet from the previous day’s 0.16” rain so the fire was a slow burn of mostly damp leaves.   By that time of day it was in the shade, and the fire reached the wide, cleared path where the power lines run through the woods, providing a ready-made fire break.  The fire department stayed for several hours making sure it didn’t reignite. Scary!  We have had a wide range of high and low temps this past week, max. 65.9 F and min. low of 21.4 F.  Winds have gusted to 37 mph.  Our snow event for Saturday and Sunday didn’t materialize. Not even flurries!  The only downside to that was we could have used the moisture.  Our Bradford pear trees are blooming and the peach tree now has a few more blossoms.  Our forsythia bush is almost in full bloom.  The ground is soft in most areas.  A 300+ acre field in our neighborhood planted with what appears to be a cover crop is a lush green.  The water in Brush Creek, however, still continues to run on the low side.  As to wildlife, as I was scurrying down the hill to see where the brush fire was, I spooked a deer, the largest one I have seen around here in quite some time.  Our birds are still very active at the feeders each day.  I am keeping an eye out for migrating bobolinks.  We have seen them before in the pasture in front of our house in March and in April.

I've seen a couple robins around but not in the numbers I normally see late in the winter. Some area ponds are looking good at this point while others are struggling. I suppose that may be related to how they're being fed, i.e. spring-fed, etc. My brother-in-law continues to feed his livestock since, even with the improved rainfall, it takes the grass some time to rebound.

The majority of damage occurred in evergreen species, according to Dana Stone, a forester with the Alabama Forestry Commission.  Pines, Leland cypress, Japanese cypress, cedars, magnolias and even oak trees were the most affected, stated Stone.  A number of pests were attacking the trees, including Southern pine beetle, Ips engraver beetle, black turpentine beetle and the deodar weevil, or a combination of those insects.  Huntsville Times (Ala.), May 10, 2017Alabama trees continued to die, despite rainfall in December and January, said the Alabama Forestry Commission.  The reason for the trees deaths was not clear, but the losses may be significant.  The AFC began receiving calls about pine trees of all ages and sizes dying, ranging from seedlings to mature trees.  Needles frequently turn brown, as do the pitch tubes, indicating bark beetle infestation.  Inspections of the dying trees revealed a variety of pests, including Southern pine beetle, Ips engraver beetle, and black turpentine beetle, or a combination of all three.

Western wheatgrass, which is our predominant grass, is currently 6-8 inches tall and the leaves are thin and spindly. Green needlegrass went to seed in late May, with virtually no leaf matter for grazing, alfalfa (we have volunteer alfalfa - not a planted crop) is flowering and some has already gone to seed at about 10 to 12 inches.

We received snow over the winter but it had very little moisture in it and what it did have just soaked in.  There was little to no runoff.  This ongoing drought is having a huge impact on all the producers in Perkins County.  From an agriculture standpoint most of the hay crops and grain crops are a failure.  Most of the winter wheat has burned up and is currently getting put up for hay.  I just started to put up our alfalfa/grass hay and it is the worst hay crop I've ever put up.  Most of it isn't worth cutting and I would say the production is at 10-20% of normal. The range conditions are serious also.  We did get a small amount of rain in early April and that tried to jump start the native grasses.  We sold some cows that we would normally keep and I have several neighbors who have sold cow/calf pairs and even their replacement heifers.  Once pastures have been grazed there is no regrowth.  Pastures have been turning brown and cattle are walking over as much grass as they're eating.  Stock dams are dry or drying up.  We had to move cattle from a pasture with decent grass because the water samples came back toxic.  Calves were getting sick from the bad water.  The spring crops are very short and were already heading out a week ago.  Unless something happens soon with rain, I would say that they will all be hayed.  That is if they are even worth cutting.We were digging post holes for new fence and there is no subsoil moisture down 4 feet.  Dry all the way down.

Loggers began arriving in 2015 as the U.S. Forest Service reported 66 million dead trees, and the estimated numbers of dead trees has continued to climb.  The employment opportunity has also led some loggers to move their families from places like Oregon and Georgia because the work will last a while.  Along with an emergency order, Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.  The California Department of Transportation set aside $11 million to get rid of the trees before they fall and impede traffic to and from Yosemite National Park or hurt a motorist.  In January, CalTrans had 30,000 trees designated for removal along State Routes 41 and 168.  The agency paid as much as $1,000 per tree and already paid about $6.5 million for the removal of about 8,000 trees.

Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.

Parts of the Central Valley were sinking more than one foot each year, and some areas were ten feet lower than they used to be.  The subsidence has buckled the walls of irrigation canals, damaged pipes, created giant sink holes and cracked homes.   CBS News, Aug. 18, 2015Amid persistent drought and low water allocations, Central Valley farmers continued to over pump groundwater to irrigate crops at a high cost to groundwater stores, which were critically endangered prior to the drought.  Some areas have seen drops of 50 feet or more in their water tables in a few years with alarming and permanent land subsidence causing structural damage to canals, roads and bridges.    A Los Banos farmer noted that over pumping and land subsidence meant that water, to which he has high priority rights, would need to flow uphill to reach his fields.
