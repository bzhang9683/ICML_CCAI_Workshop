Game lands managed by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been closed. Wildfires have forced additional closures of trails, areas and roads in the Nantahala National Forest. Drought conditions are taking their toll on livestock, causing a shortage of hay and increased risk of bovine pulmonary edema and emphysema, or ABPE. Other causes of cattle mortality during drought can include plant toxicity, as the limited pasture may mean animals are more likely to eat plants, buckeyes and acorns that they normally wouldn't. Containment percentages have increased substantially over the past week. The drought though, has resulted in a steady fall of leaf litter that is still continuing. This provides a steady stream of fuel and has posed an ongoing risk to containment lines.

In Tennessee, 1,427 fires consumed 44,027 acres, according to the Tennessee Division of Forestry.  The 50-year average was 2,817 fires burning 32,245 acres.“This fire season was unique in that the sheer number of large fires over a large area was unprecedented,” explained Tim Phelps of the state Division of Forestry. “This was activated by the long drought we have had for months.”The total cost of fighting Tennessee’s fires has not yet been tallied, but Tennessee Forester Jere Jeter estimated costs to the state Division of Forestry exceeding $6 million before the Sevier County fires.  The joint information office for the Sevier County fires indicated a cost of $5,916,962 for the Chimney Tops fire and $265,363 for the fire at nearby Cobbly Nob.  Costs from local, state and national agencies were included in the estimates.  The U.S. Forest Service’s South Area Coordination Center was still tabulating numbers, but statistics showed that 323 significant fires charred more than 288,457 acres since the start of October in the South.  “Significant” fires are those consuming more than 100 acres.
