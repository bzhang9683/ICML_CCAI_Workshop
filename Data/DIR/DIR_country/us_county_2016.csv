He said boat owners were trying to find a way to get their boats out of the lake without dragging them over  rocks to bring them onshore.  This spring, a dam on the lake was left open later than usual, allowing a lot of water to leave.  “There’s no question, the water levels are down almost everywhere, with very few exceptions,” said Scott Williams, director of the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program, which monitors conditions at about 450 lakes and ponds in the state. “We really have had one of the driest spring and summer seasons on record.”  Vegetation in shallow parts of ponds has died, which will limit habitat when the water returns.  On the bright side, the waters of area lakes were exceptionally clean because there has been little rain to stir up pollutants, soil and other debris and wash it into ponds, where it can promote algae growth.

She stated that it was unlikely that nearly nine out of ten water districts would have enough water if drought persisted for three additional years.  “The requirements of the regulations allowed water districts to be overly optimistic,” she said. “The zero percent (conservation targets) we are seeing aren’t real numbers.”The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 16, 2016","Relief, Response & Restrictions, Water Supply & Quality","California, Alameda County, CA, Alpine County, CA, Amador County, CA, Butte County, CA, Calaveras County, CA, Colusa County, CA, Contra Costa County, CA, Del Norte County, CA, El Dorado County, CA, Fresno County, CA, Glenn County, CA, Humboldt County, CA, Imperial County, CA, Inyo County, CA, Kern County, CA, Kings County, CA, Lake County, CA, Lassen County, CA, Los Angeles County, CA, Madera County, CA, Marin County, CA, Mariposa County, CA, Mendocino County, CA, Merced County, CA, Modoc County, CA, Mono County, CA, Monterey County, CA, Napa County, CA, Nevada County, CA, Orange County, CA, Placer County, CA, Plumas County, CA, Riverside County, CA, Sacramento County, CA, San Benito County, CA, San Bernardino County, CA, San Diego County, CA, San Francisco County, CA, San Joaquin County, CA, San Luis Obispo County, CA, San Mateo County, CA, Santa Barbara County, CA, Santa Clara County, CA, Santa Cruz County, CA, Shasta County, CA, Sierra County, CA, Siskiyou County, CA, Solano County, CA, Sonoma County, CA, Stanislaus County, CA, Sutter County, CA, Tehama County, CA, Trinity County, CA, Tulare County, CA, Tuolumne County, CA, Ventura County, CA, Yolo County, CA, Yuba County, CA"

Jerry Brown, is the order of the day.  With the reduction in outdoor water use has come a neglect for trees that has killed millions of them statewide.  Stressed and wilting from water loss, numerous redwoods, oaks, magnolias and other species of trees have been losing leaves and limbs, according to arborists.Water utilities have lost more than half a billion dollars in just the last eight months as customers conserve water, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.   The drop in revenue should continue through October, due to the board’s extension of the water conservation targets, and will likely lead to water rate increases as some districts work to balance the loss.  Intense water conservation has also led to other problems, too.  Sewer lines designed to carry away solid waste using about 120 gallons per household per day have only had a flow of about 50 gallons per person per day, leaving solids sitting in pipes.  As the material lingers, it gives off hydrogen sulfide and also corrodes the pipes.With the intention of saving water, Californians dutifully replaced lawns with desert-themed foliage, aided by rebates offered by their water districts, but homeowners were unaware that the Internal Revenue Service would tax the rebates as income.  Rebates up to $2,000 were not taxed by the state.

The Mesa Water District, which serves 108,000 customers in Costa Mesa and portions of Newport Beach, has had its conservation goal cut from 20 percent down to 13 percent.The water target for Newport Beach was lowered to 21 percent from the original 28 percent goal.  From June 2015 through February, Newport Beach water customers have curbed their water use by 19.9 percent, putting the new conservation goal more easily within their reach than the original goal.  Habitual water wasters will still be fined, and in February, the city issued 1,284 notices of violation.Los Angeles Times, March 31, 2016California water regulators proposed easing water conservation targets, particularly for communities that have lost trees for lack of water and for communities that have developed alternative water supplies, such as those with desalination plants.  The state’s conservation goal of 25 percent could drop if all water agencies requested adjustments, from the 27 percent achieved since June to about 22 percent, said Max Gomberg, climate and conservation manager for the State Water Resources Control Board.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Dec. 21, 2015Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, said that the water conservation mandates, requiring a cut of as much as 36 percent of water consumption compared to the baseline year of 2013, would be tweaked somewhat to seem more fair.  Many have complained that the mandates do not take into account individual circumstances or population changes and are too severe.  The state water board created the mandates within three weeks of the governor’s April 2015 order for a 25 percent cutback in water use and did not have the luxury of time to fine-tune the water targets.Palm Springs Desert Sun (Calif.), Dec. 3, 2015","Relief, Response & Restrictions, Society & Public Health, Water Supply & Quality",California

Water providers must, however, ensure that they have three years’ worth of water in reserve, and, if not, adopt  water-savings target to have a three-year supply.  A number of statewide conservation measures were extended.  Residents, for example, must not allow water runoff when irrigating their lawns, wash cars without a shut-off nozzle or use potable water in a fountain or to wash off pavement.

Loggers began arriving in 2015 as the U.S. Forest Service reported 66 million dead trees, and the estimated numbers of dead trees has continued to climb.  The employment opportunity has also led some loggers to move their families from places like Oregon and Georgia because the work will last a while.  Along with an emergency order, Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.  The California Department of Transportation set aside $11 million to get rid of the trees before they fall and impede traffic to and from Yosemite National Park or hurt a motorist.  In January, CalTrans had 30,000 trees designated for removal along State Routes 41 and 168.  The agency paid as much as $1,000 per tree and already paid about $6.5 million for the removal of about 8,000 trees.

Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 6, 2015The California Water Resources Control Board was asked by the state Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to further relax water standards in coming months so that more water can be held back in reservoirs, such as Shasta, Oroville and Folsom.  Some of the consequences of reduced flows will be saltier water for farmers who pull water from sloughs and channels in the estuary and lower flows in many estuary channels and upstream rivers.Endangered species will be monitored to ensure that they are not unduly harmed by the management changes, which could be adjusted to better protect fish, if needed.Fresno Bee (Calif.), April 10, 2014The drought emergency declaration on Jan. 17 softened some environmental rules and water quality standards, allowing water that is saltier and warmer than previously permitted in rivers and estuaries.

30622,Stricter water conservation measures for California,11/14/15,1/17/14,10/31/16,"Gov. Jerry Brown extended the executive order requiring Californians to continue conserving water through October 2016 if drought conditions remain in January 2016.  State water authorities have expanded powers to cope with drought and El Niño-enhanced storms expected this winter.  Some environmental rules remained suspended, and the capture of abundant rainfall was encouraged.The New York Times, Nov. 14, 2015Gov. Jerry Brown ordered new water restrictions requiring urban Californians to curtail water use by 25 percent, compared to 2013 levels.  The announcement came as the state’s April 1 snow measurement revealed the smallest amount of snow for that date since record-keeping began 65 years ago.  From Gov. Jerry Brown’s Ca.gov website, some of the actions in the executive order include:•	A mandatory 25 percent reduction in water use •	Replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought tolerant landscaping in partnership with local governments•	Create a temporary, statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with more water and energy efficient models•	Require campuses, golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscapes to make significant cuts in water use•	Prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless water-efficient drip irrigation systems are used, and ban watering of ornamental grass on public street medians•	Adjust water rate structures to implement conservation pricing at local level•	Agricultural water users must report more water use information to state regulators•	Take action against water agencies in depleted groundwater basins that have not shared data on their groundwater supplies with the state•	Update standards for toilets and faucets and outdoor landscaping in residential communities and take action against communities that ignore these standards•	Make permanent monthly reporting of water usage, conservation and enforcement actions by local water suppliersSan Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), April 1, 2015The California State Water Resources Control Board tightened water restrictions to prolong water supplies as the state entered its fourth year of drought.  Local water departments were charged with enforcing the rules.Among the new water-conserving mandates:•	Restaurant patrons must request water, not be served water automatically.•	Hotel guests must be given the option of reusing towels and sheets.  Signs must be placed in the bathroom notifying guests of the choice.•	Local water departments must limit days of permitted lawn watering.  Homeowners may not irrigate yards during or within two days of rainfall.•	Local water departments must alert customers of leaks.•	Water restrictions instituted in July 2014 remain in effect.•	Local water departments must report how they enforce the new rules.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), March 17, 2015The California Water Resources Control Board considered introducing more restrictions in an effort to increase water conservation.  Last summer, water regulators established statewide water restrictions and allowed water agencies to fine scofflaws $500, an option few water providers, if any, have used.  The board intends to begin tracking compliance with the water restrictions to know how effective the measures are.  An Associated Press investigation found a wide range of enforcement among cities.  In the southern California city of Coachella, homes with lush green lawns had not been warned to use less water, while San Ramon and Dublin water customers had racked up nearly $40,000 in fines after access to a primary water source was lost.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), March 15, 2015The California State Water Resources Control Board is considering extending current water restrictions and adopting additional limits on water use as the state heads into its fourth year of drought.  Among the possible measures are requiring restaurant customers to request water and hotel guests to ask for new towels and sheets.  Previous mandatory restrictions implemented during the 2014 summer include a ban on car washing without a shutoff nozzle on the hose and limitations on lawn watering.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Feb. 18, 2015Lackluster water conservation efforts led California officials to adopt more severe water conservation measures prohibiting outdoor watering, except for two days per week, car washing without a shutoff nozzle and pavement washing.  Violators may be fined up to $500 per day.  These new measures were needed because the public did not conserve up to 20 percent, as the governor requested, and during May, used 1 percent more water than usual.  Most of the state’s 10 hydraulic regions curbed their water use by 5 percent in May, but residents of the South Coast region, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County, used 8 percent more water than normal.The new water restrictions will take effect sometime around Aug. 1.

Salmon grow, spawn and die in three-year cycles, making three consecutive years of drought challenges all the populations can stand before going extinct. During 2014 and 2015, millions of young salmon were raised in hatcheries to keep fall-run Chinook salmon thriving. Winter-run Chinook salmon received a federal listing in 2015 as one of the eight U.S. species most in danger of imminent extinction after drought depleted California’s rivers in 2014 and 2015, leaving river water too warm and low to sustain the fish.

The loss in electricity generation cost PG&E and other California utilities roughly $5.5 billion, according to a study done by researchers at North Carolina State University.  Much of the shortfall in hydropower production was made up by natural gas, a more expensive form of energy production.  The lost hydropower production cost utilities $1.5 billion and the higher demand for electricity amounted to nearly $4 billion.  In 2015 at the height of California’s drought, hydropower met only 6 percent of the Golden State’s electricity needs, whereas it usually covered 15 percent of demand.

The return to more rainfall and less drought has helped trees resist the bark beetles that have damaged and killed so many trees.  Since drought began in 2010, more than 147 million trees on 9.7 million acres died.  The slowing rate of tree mortality was encouraging.  Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.  The trees were stressed and dehydrated by drought, making them more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations and other ills.The density of dead trees was so great in areas that foresters closed roads and campgrounds to protect the public from falling trees.

The 50-year average was 2,817 fires burning 32,245 acres.“This fire season was unique in that the sheer number of large fires over a large area was unprecedented,” explained Tim Phelps of the state Division of Forestry. “This was activated by the long drought we have had for months.”The total cost of fighting Tennessee’s fires has not yet been tallied, but Tennessee Forester Jere Jeter estimated costs to the state Division of Forestry exceeding $6 million before the Sevier County fires.  The joint information office for the Sevier County fires indicated a cost of $5,916,962 for the Chimney Tops fire and $265,363 for the fire at nearby Cobbly Nob.  Costs from local, state and national agencies were included in the estimates.  The U.S. Forest Service’s South Area Coordination Center was still tabulating numbers, but statistics showed that 323 significant fires charred more than 288,457 acres since the start of October in the South.  “Significant” fires are those consuming more than 100 acres.
