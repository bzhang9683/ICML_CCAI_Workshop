Some producers have begun feeding hay and protein. Most corn is being chopped for silage. In the Rolling Plains, cotton fields have dried out, and recently emerged cotton plants are stressed. Hay fields are producing less than usual. In the eastern part of the state, crop growth has slowed throughout the area. In the south plains, at least half of the dryland cotton acres did not come up, and farmers are making replant decisions about whether to plant cotton, fallow, or sorghum. In the panhandle, weeds are a problem throughout the district, and pastures and rangelands are in fair to poor condition. In the north, pastures are showing drought stress, and hay yields are about half of last year’s yield. In west central Texas, dryland grain sorghum and cotton are affected. In southwest Texas, water availability is a problem and supplemental feeding is continuing for livestock and wildlife. In southern Texas, stock tank water levels have declined in dry areas, and producers with livestock on native rangeland and pastures report supplemental feeding activity. Some producers are selling off livestock to relieve grazing pressure on native rangeland and pastures.Bryan-College Station Eagle (TX), July 3, 2018","Agriculture, Water Supply & Quality",Texas,

36275,Most Maine lakes unusually low,09/14/2016,09/14/2016, ,"Drought and other factors lowered the level of Swan Lake to the extent that some boat and docks were resting on dry land, noted Marty Stout, president of the Swan Lake Association.  He said boat owners were trying to find a way to get their boats out of the lake without dragging them over  rocks to bring them onshore.  This spring, a dam on the lake was left open later than usual, allowing a lot of water to leave.  “There’s no question, the water levels are down almost everywhere, with very few exceptions,” said Scott Williams, director of the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program, which monitors conditions at about 450 lakes and ponds in the state. “We really have had one of the driest spring and summer seasons on record.”  Vegetation in shallow parts of ponds has died, which will limit habitat when the water returns.  On the bright side, the waters of area lakes were exceptionally clean because there has been little rain to stir up pollutants, soil and other debris and wash it into ponds, where it can promote algae growth.

State officials did not audit stress test results, but depended on the water districts to offer honest assessments of their water supplies.Tracy Quinn, a policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said her research showed that water districts were overestimating the depth of their supplies.  She stated that it was unlikely that nearly nine out of ten water districts would have enough water if drought persisted for three additional years.  “The requirements of the regulations allowed water districts to be overly optimistic,” she said. “The zero percent (conservation targets) we are seeing aren’t real numbers.”The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 16, 2016","Relief, Response & Restrictions, Water Supply & Quality","California, Alameda County, CA, Alpine County, CA, Amador County, CA, Butte County, CA, Calaveras County, CA, Colusa County, CA, Contra Costa County, CA, Del Norte County, CA, El Dorado County, CA, Fresno County, CA, Glenn County, CA, Humboldt County, CA, Imperial County, CA, Inyo County, CA, Kern County, CA, Kings County, CA, Lake County, CA, Lassen County, CA, Los Angeles County, CA, Madera County, CA, Marin County, CA, Mariposa County, CA, Mendocino County, CA, Merced County, CA, Modoc County, CA, Mono County, CA, Monterey County, CA, Napa County, CA, Nevada County, CA, Orange County, CA, Placer County, CA, Plumas County, CA, Riverside County, CA, Sacramento County, CA, San Benito County, CA, San Bernardino County, CA, San Diego County, CA, San Francisco County, CA, San Joaquin County, CA, San Luis Obispo County, CA, San Mateo County, CA, Santa Barbara County, CA, Santa Clara County, CA, Santa Cruz County, CA, Shasta County, CA, Sierra County, CA, Siskiyou County, CA, Solano County, CA, Sonoma County, CA, Stanislaus County, CA, Sutter County, CA, Tehama County, CA, Trinity County, CA, Tulare County, CA, Tuolumne County, CA, Ventura County, CA, Yolo County, CA, Yuba County, CA",

Often water rates rise with lower water sales, or drought surcharges help make up the difference in revenue.

In Santa Barbara, revenue was anticipated to fall $5 million if customers achieved the 20 percent cut in water use.

Direct crop revenue losses stemming from drought come to $900 million and will cost dairy and livestock producers $350 million.  Rice, alfalfa and corn production were most affected by the drought.The largest portion of the loss estimate came from the fallowing of 542,000 acres for lack of irrigation water, amounting to about 20 percent more land than was idled in 2014. With fewer acres in production, farm workers were expected to be out of 10,100 seasonal farm jobs.  Including indirect job losses, the overall job loss figure climbs to 21,000.  Statewide, farmers were nearly 9 million acre-feet short of the 28 million acre-feet used in a typical year for irrigation.  To keep crops alive, an additional 6 million acre-feet of groundwater was being pumped in 2015, withdrawing the water at an unprecedented rate.

Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.

Production was down for rice, grapes, oranges, hay, corn, pistachios and almonds. Economists at UC Davis found in a study earlier this year that agriculture would likely suffer a $2.2 billion loss this year due to higher water costs and revenue losses, as an estimated 420,000 acres of farmland were left unplanted.  Farm employment dipped by 2,700 jobs, said the state Employment Development Department, although it’s difficult to get an exact count since many workers are transient and work part-time.  Experts at UC Davis expect up to 17,000 lost jobs.  With fewer people receiving paychecks, the demand for food aid through local food banks has risen.

In some instances, fire crews used portable pumps that had to be carried to the water’s edge to draw water after lakes dwindled, exposing a muddy or steep lake bed.  At other times, water bodies were too shallow for a helicopter’s bucket to dip into the water to refill, spurring fire crews to be creative to get the water needed to put out a fire.Various water-conserving tactics were used in place of traditional water.  When feasible, crews set backfires to clear vegetation or used firefighting foam to smother a fire rather than spraying water on it.Water agencies were also working more closely with firefighters to make water accessible by allowing firefighters to use small area reservoirs.Portable tanks were another helpful means of getting the needed water for firefighting.  Water-tender trucks can usually carry 3,500 gallons of water, while the portable tanks can hold up to 5,000 gallons, so it can take two vehicles, which sometimes must travel long distances to bring the water, to fill a tank.Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Sept. 25, 2014","Fire, Relief, Response & Restrictions","California, El Dorado County, CA, Placer County, CA, Sacramento County, CA",

The State Water Resources Control Board were revising water restrictions which will take effect in June.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), May 3, 2016Gov. Jerry Brown mandated 25 percent water conservation between June 2015 and February 2016, compared to the same months in 2013, and Californians just missed the target at 23.9 percent.  Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, lauded the effort, saying “Californians rose to the occasion, reducing irrigation, fixing leaks, taking shorter showers and saving our precious water resources in all sorts of ways.""  Altogether, the public saved enough water during those nine months to serve nearly 6 million Californians for a full year, which is still a considerable feat.  Water conservation in February amounted to just 12 percent.  The Sacramento Bee, April 4, 2016Water conservation in California slipped further to 17.1 percent in January, while the overall conservation since June 2015 dipped to 24.8 percent, missing the governor’s end of February savings goal of 25 percent.  Even though conservation was down in January, California residences used an average of 61 gallons per person per day, setting a new record, and beating December’s per capita daily water use of 67 gallons.Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Feb. 25, 2016California’s urban residents curbed their water use by 18.3 percent in December compared to December 2013.  This was the month of least conservation since Gov. Jerry Brown ordered his state’s residents to conserve at least 25 percent of water used compared to 2013.  From June through December 2015, Californians cumulatively have saved 25.5 percent, exceeding the governor’s mandate.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Feb. 3, 2016Conservation efforts yielded less water saved in November when Californians curbed water use by 20 percent.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Jan. 5, 2016Water conservation in California dipped to 22 percent in October as warmer temperatures, compared to the benchmark year of 2013, likely led to more lawn watering.  October was also the first month that conservation fell below the mandated 25 percent since enforcement started in June.  Since June, water conservation efforts have saved an average of 27 percent per month, already putting the state at 76 percent of its conservation goal through February 2016.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Dec. 1, 2015Californians cut their water use 26 percent in September, exceeding the governor’s goal of a 25 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013 water use.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Oct. 30, 2015For the third month, Californians have exceeded the governor’s request for 25 percent water conservation and saved 27 percent in August 2015, compared to August 2013.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 1, 2015California urban water use fell 31 percent in July, compared with water use in 2013, for a savings of more than 74 billion gallons.  The 31 percent water savings well exceeds the governor’s mandate for a 25 percent reduction in water use.  Roughly 4 in 5 of the state’s about 420 water districts met the 25 percent goal in July.  Most big cities also made their conservation targets, but four water districts missed their target by more than 15 percent.As water customers use less water, utilities lose revenue when less water is sold, yet fixed costs for maintenance and operations of water delivery systems remain.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 27, 2015Californians curbed their water use in June by 27 percent, according to the State Water Resources Control Board, exceeding the governor’s demand for 25 percent water conservation.  Of the 400 individual conservation targets assigned to the state’s largest water agencies, about two-thirds successfully made their goals.  Sixteen agencies—mostly in central or southern California—missed their conservation target by more than 15 percentage points.  One small Central Valley community, ordered to cut water use by 32 percent, only lowered its water use by 3 percent.Another 71 water agencies missed their goal by 5 to 15 percentage points, while 53 water providers fell short of their target by 1 to 5 percent.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), July 30, 2015Californians’ best showing in water conservation occurred in May with a 29 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013.  The May conservation effort exceeded the governor’s April order to curb water use by 25 percent.  May rains could have influenced the conservation rate, with fewer people watering lawns.  The Sacramento area cut water use by nearly 40 percent, leading the state in water savings, while the southern coast, including Los Angeles and San Diego used 25 percent less water, an improvement over the past few months.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com)The public stepped up their water conservation efforts and used 13.5 percent less water in April compared with April 2013, an improvement over water savings of 3 percent in February and 4 percent in March.KFSN-TV ABC 30 Frenso/Visalia (Calif.), June 2, 2015Water conservation in March rose to 8.6 percent, considerably below the 25 percent mandatory cut in water use ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown.Los Angeles Times, May 5, 2015Water use in California fell less than 3 percent in February, compared to February 2013, as poor water conservation efforts raised alarm and led to mandatory targets for conservation by city, depending on the city’s per capita water use.  Along the south coast from Los Angeles to San Diego, water use was higher, indicating the need for drastic changes to water habits in light of the intense drought pummeling the state.  Statewide water conservation was about 9 percent since the governor requested a voluntary reduction in water use in January 2014.The New York Times, April 7, 2015Water use in January 2015 was 8.8 percent lower than the previous January’s, rebounding from a December 2014 conservation success of 22.2 percent, surpassing the governor’s conservation goal of 20 percent.  An exceedingly dry January likely led to some lawn watering, which may have bumped up water use.Per capita water consumption was 73 gallons in January, up from 67 gallons in December.Los Angeles Times, March 5, 2015Abundant December rainfall helped Californians cut their water use by 22 percent, allowing residents to finally bring their water conservation above the 20 percent mark as requested by Gov. Brown in January 2014.  The public has done an impressive job of lowering per capita water use in the past six months.  In June, California per capita water use was 140 gallons per day, but in December, that number was down to an average of 67 gallons per day.  Cities among  the lowest water users in December were San Diego with a per capita water use of 46 gallons per day and San Francisco with a daily use of 40 gallons per day.San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Feb. 3, 2015Statewide, water conservation climbed to 9.8 percent in November in comparison with November 2013 water use.  In the South Coast region, comprised of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties, conservation amounted to 3.2 percent, while in the Bay Area and Sacramento, water consumption was 18 and 25 percent.  Temperature differences and more rainfall in Northern California may have contributed to the range in conservation results.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Jan. 6, 2015Despite Gov. Brown’s request for conservation of 20 percent, Californians only curbed their water use by 6.7 percent in October, compared with the previous year and by 11.6 percent in August, state residents’ best showing since the appeal for conservation.  The state Water Resources Control Board said that 90 billion gallons of water have been conserved since June.  The state’s primary reservoirs held 39 percent to 60 percent of normal water levels for this time of year.  In addition, the average Northern Sierra snowpack was 79 percent of normal, while the southern Sierra was 47 percent of normal.ABC News, Dec. 3, 2014Southern Californians cut their water use by 1.4 percent in October, compared with the previous year, but some water customers used more water, according to figures from the State Water Resources Control Board.  Residents in the Costa Mesa Water District used 12.5 percent more water, with per capita water use climbing from 80 gallons per day to 90 gallons daily.  Other communities using more water included Trabuco Canyon Water District, Brea, Santa Margarita Water District, San Clemente, City of San Juan Capistrano Water Department, Moulton Niguel Water District and Anaheim.  Water districts using less water were the East Orange County Water District, where people used an average of 270 gallons of water per person daily in October for a decrease of 5.8 percent.  Newport Beach water customers used 25.7 percent less water.  La Palma and Garden Grove also trimmed their water consumption.Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Dec. 2, 2014Water conservation in California waned slightly in September, with savings of 10.3 percent or about 22 million gallons, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.  Per capita water use varied from less than 50 gallons per day up to more than 500 per day.  In Beverly Hills, usage was 286 gallons per person per day and in the East Los Angeles district of the California Water Service Co., it was 48 gallons per person per day.  Southern Californians on average used 119 gallons per person per day.Los Angeles Times, Nov. 4, 2014Californians curbed water use by 11.5 percent in August, compared with the previous year, for an increase in water savings.  Parts of Southern California made substantial progress in water conservation, from using 8 percent more water in May to using 7.8 percent less in August.  Gov. Brown urged residents to cut their water use by 20 percent, putting Californians a little more than halfway to the goal.  More water agencies are providing water use data.  In May, providing data to estimate water conservation was voluntary, with 63 percent of water agencies participating. while in August, about 95 percent shared water use figures.  The City of Tracy cut water use by 41 percent in August and was one of 20 cities trimming their water use by 20 percent.  State officials had special praise for Long Beach, which has long been working to conserve water, but still achieved a reduction in water use of 6.8 percent.  Long Beach had brought its water use down to the lowest point since 1958.Los Angeles Times, Oct. 7, 2014Despite the request for a 20 percent reduction in water use, Californians have curbed their water consumption by 7.5 percent, according to water agencies.  While some cities used more water in July in comparison with  the previous year, many cities cut their consumption in July.  Some of the cities and water districts that reduced their water use include the California Water Service Company Livermore in Alameda County, 38 percent reduction; City of Pleasanton in Alameda County, 37 percent reduction; Dublin San Ramon Services District in Alameda County, 34 percent; City of Woodland in Yolo County, 27 percent; Sacramento Suburban Water District, 26 percent; City of Santa Cruz, 25 percent;  Placer County Water Agency, 22 percent; City of Sacramento, 22 percent; Alameda County Water District, 22 percent; and Citrus Heights Water District in Sacramento County, 21 percent.Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Sept. 9, 2014The South Coast Hydrologic Region, including Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Diego, curbed its water use by 1.7 percent in July, which was better than May when water use rose 8 percent.  Reductions in water use between northern and southern parts of the state were not always fair comparisons because some areas had already taken greater strides toward water conservation than other areas.Water conservation efforts were more apparent after the state adopted emergency conservation regulations in July.  In May, water use rose 1.5 percent; in June, water use fell 4.4 percent, but in July, water consumption fell 7.5 percent.

30622,Stricter water conservation measures for California,11/14/2015,01/17/2014,10/31/2016,"Gov. Jerry Brown extended the executive order requiring Californians to continue conserving water through October 2016 if drought conditions remain in January 2016.  State water authorities have expanded powers to cope with drought and El Niño-enhanced storms expected this winter.  Some environmental rules remained suspended, and the capture of abundant rainfall was encouraged.The New York Times, Nov. 14, 2015Gov. Jerry Brown ordered new water restrictions requiring urban Californians to curtail water use by 25 percent, compared to 2013 levels.  The announcement came as the state’s April 1 snow measurement revealed the smallest amount of snow for that date since record-keeping began 65 years ago.  From Gov. Jerry Brown’s Ca.gov website, some of the actions in the executive order include:•	A mandatory 25 percent reduction in water use •	Replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought tolerant landscaping in partnership with local governments•	Create a temporary, statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with more water and energy efficient models•	Require campuses, golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscapes to make significant cuts in water use•	Prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless water-efficient drip irrigation systems are used, and ban watering of ornamental grass on public street medians•	Adjust water rate structures to implement conservation pricing at local level•	Agricultural water users must report more water use information to state regulators•	Take action against water agencies in depleted groundwater basins that have not shared data on their groundwater supplies with the state•	Update standards for toilets and faucets and outdoor landscaping in residential communities and take action against communities that ignore these standards•	Make permanent monthly reporting of water usage, conservation and enforcement actions by local water suppliersSan Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), April 1, 2015The California State Water Resources Control Board tightened water restrictions to prolong water supplies as the state entered its fourth year of drought.  Local water departments were charged with enforcing the rules.Among the new water-conserving mandates:•	Restaurant patrons must request water, not be served water automatically.•	Hotel guests must be given the option of reusing towels and sheets.  Signs must be placed in the bathroom notifying guests of the choice.•	Local water departments must limit days of permitted lawn watering.  Homeowners may not irrigate yards during or within two days of rainfall.•	Local water departments must alert customers of leaks.•	Water restrictions instituted in July 2014 remain in effect.•	Local water departments must report how they enforce the new rules.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), March 17, 2015The California Water Resources Control Board considered introducing more restrictions in an effort to increase water conservation.  Last summer, water regulators established statewide water restrictions and allowed water agencies to fine scofflaws $500, an option few water providers, if any, have used.  The board intends to begin tracking compliance with the water restrictions to know how effective the measures are.  An Associated Press investigation found a wide range of enforcement among cities.  In the southern California city of Coachella, homes with lush green lawns had not been warned to use less water, while San Ramon and Dublin water customers had racked up nearly $40,000 in fines after access to a primary water source was lost.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), March 15, 2015The California State Water Resources Control Board is considering extending current water restrictions and adopting additional limits on water use as the state heads into its fourth year of drought.  Among the possible measures are requiring restaurant customers to request water and hotel guests to ask for new towels and sheets.  Previous mandatory restrictions implemented during the 2014 summer include a ban on car washing without a shutoff nozzle on the hose and limitations on lawn watering.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Feb. 18, 2015Lackluster water conservation efforts led California officials to adopt more severe water conservation measures prohibiting outdoor watering, except for two days per week, car washing without a shutoff nozzle and pavement washing.  Violators may be fined up to $500 per day.  These new measures were needed because the public did not conserve up to 20 percent, as the governor requested, and during May, used 1 percent more water than usual.  Most of the state’s 10 hydraulic regions curbed their water use by 5 percent in May, but residents of the South Coast region, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County, used 8 percent more water than normal.The new water restrictions will take effect sometime around Aug. 1.

Water conservation in the Bay Area amounted to about 2 percent of the average water use, based on the January through May three-year average.  In parts of Imperial, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties, conservation of about one percent was reported.  Just 61 percent of the state’s water agencies responded to the survey, giving only a partial assessment of the true water conservation statewide.Overall, areas of California suffering the worst water shortages were also the areas that saved the most water.  In the Sacramento area, water conservation was 10 percent; in much of the San Joaquin Valley, 7 percent.Fifty-three percent of the state’s water districts have developed drought plans, and 44 percent of water agencies said that water shortages were not a problem.

Farmers were compensating for the loss by increasing groundwater pumping, and in some areas, pumping more than twice as much water as last year. Groundwater has been essential in helping the state get through this drought without larger economic losses.The California Department of Food and Agriculture’s Office of Public Relations summarized the study’s findings as follows:•	Direct costs to agriculture total $1.5 billion (revenue losses of $1 billion and $0.5 billion in additional pumping costs). This net revenue loss is about 3 percent of the state’s total agricultural value.•	The total statewide economic cost of the 2014 drought is $2.2 billion.•	The loss of 17,100 seasonal and part-time jobs related to agriculture represents 3.8 percent of farm unemployment.•	428,000 acres, or 5 percent, of irrigated cropland is going out of production in the Central Valley, Central Coast and Southern California due to the drought.•	The Central Valley is hardest hit, particularly the Tulare Basin, with projected losses of $810 million, or 2.3 percent, in crop revenue; $203 million in dairy and livestock value; and $453 million in additional well-pumping costs.•	Agriculture on the Central Coast and in Southern California will be less affected by this year’s drought, with about 19,150 acres fallowed, $10 million in lost crop revenue and $6.3 million in additional pumping costs.•	Overdraft of groundwater is expected to cause additional wells in the Tulare Basin to run dry if the drought continues.•	The drought is likely to continue through 2015, regardless of El Niño conditions.•	Consumer food prices will be largely unaffected. Higher prices at the grocery store of high-value California crops like nuts, wine grapes and dairy foods are driven more by market demand than by the drought.Napa Valley Register (Calif.), July 16, 2014","Agriculture, Relief, Response & Restrictions, Water Supply & Quality",California,

El Paso County and Colorado Springs have spent $209,000 dealing with the pesky tumbleweeds.The troublesome tumbleweeds have trapped people in homes and an elementary school and also prompted firefighters to rescue a pregnant woman, who was afraid that she would not be able to get out of her home when she went into labor.Colorado cattle would normally eat the tumbleweed, but drought has forced ranchers to sell many of their livestock, leaving too few animals to keep the tumbleweed in check.  Burning the tumbleweed would be one way to get rid of them, but given the trouble the state has had with wildfires and the way tumbleweeds blow with the wind, it seems an unwise option.

In eastern El Paso County, tumbleweeds blocked rural roads and even impeded traffic on Interstate 25 near Monument.  A woman living 12 miles southeast of Callahan said that her fences were thick with tumbleweeds and she didn’t know how to get rid of them.

They discussed the tumbleweeds and explored options for financial assistance for dealing with the tumbleweeds, including federal resources and prevention.  The community service director of Fountain said that the weeds were not visibly appealing and were a potential fire hazard, but noted that it was difficult to deal with the things.  The brush is not easy to break down.A maintenance supervisor for Region 2 of the Colorado Department of Transportation said it was challenging keeping fence lines clean because the weeds collect there.  The tumbleweeds also get caught under wooden bridges and must be removed to reduce the fire hazard.  The Crowley County commissioner expressed frustration with the weeds that have been problematic for months, ""They are just absolutely everywhere.  They're like herding cats or maybe trying to catch balloons.  You hit them with the snowplow and they bounce away, then they move back in behind you.

A small fly called a biting midge passes the virus to deer.  EHD often occurs during drought and usually begins mid-August, although reports of dead deer surfaced in mid-July.

More than 50 dead deer were discovered in Putnam County, while another 15 dead deer were found in Morgan County.  Samples were taken from the deer to verify that this is indeed an EHD outbreak, but it appears to be the case, especially since EHD has been discovered in Michigan.

The president of Spirit Horse Equine Rescue Center in Janesville said that many horse owners have telephoned in recent weeks, seeking a home for their horses, but she cannot afford to take in any more horses.  The feed bill for the 41 horses at the sanctuary costs roughly $900 weekly, four times more than it cost one year ago.  Other horse rescue agencies were in similar straits.  Hay supplies across Wisconsin were lower than they have been in more than 50 years, by some estimates, driving prices for a small bale of hay up to $10, in comparison with $2 to $4 for a small bale in a normal year.  The hay that is available is often old and of poor quality.  Nationwide, hay supplies have not been so low since 1974, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The high hay prices have led to thefts and scams.  In Rock County, a dairy farmer paid $5,520 for 24 tons of hay, but never received the hay.  The seller was arrested.

Drought was blamed for the record number of cases, and 2015 is expected to bring more of the same.  The virus is mainly spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds and transmit the virus to humans.  Many people suffer no ill effects from the virus, while others become extremely sick and even die.When the California drought began in 2012, the number of West Nile virus cases rose to 479 from 158 the previous year.  In 2014, 798 cases were recorded, the highest number since 2005, said the California Department of Public Health.  Twenty-nine people died.  Experts attribute the elevated West Nile activity to stagnant water and water sources in populated areas bringing the virus closer to people.  The virus activity was most intense in Southern California, and especially in Orange County where 266 human cases were reported and the highest rate of infected mosquitoes was found. Water conservation measures prevented the county from flushing its underground storm drains where mosquitoes flourished.

Santa Clara County has been a hot spot for birds carrying the West Nile virus, with more than one-third of the total affected birds statewide being found there.  Health departments in Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties have been taking measures to reduce the number mosquitoes with the West Nile virus since mosquitoes transmit the disease to birds. The Santa Clara County Vector Control District found that 1 in 20 mosquitoes were infected with the West Nile virus this summer.  Eighty of Alameda County’s 92 West Nile-positive birds were found in Livermore, leading health officials to pull out the stops to eradicate the mosquitoes.Throughout California, there have been 562 human cases of West Nile reported through Oct. 21, more than twice the count at this time in 2013.  Seventeen deaths have been related to the virus since the start of the year, compared with 15 deaths in all of 2013.  Five human cases leading to the neural-invasive type of complication were confirmed in Contra Costa County.  A dozen people in Santa Clara County contracted the virus, with four being hospitalized also with neural-invasive complications.Public health officials say the uptick in West Nile virus cases could be attributed to climate, the number and types of birds and mosquitoes in an area, birds’ immune systems and drought.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 19, 2014The number of mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus was at an all-time high, said state health officials.

An entomologist who coordinates the Texas Monarch Watch, stemming from the monarch education and research organization in Kansas, was concerned about the number of dead plants, few butterflies and dying juniper in the Hill Country and noted that there was precious little to nourish the butterflies on their journey.

Groups concerned about the water supply were pushing government agencies to deny construction permits to potential power plants and were litigating to keep power plants out of some communities deemed to be short of water.  A study done by the University of Texas showed that 287 million gallons of water will be needed in 2020 to meet Texas’ electricity demand, which was roughly 100 billion gallons more than was needed in 2000, but the water demand already exceeds supply, according to a water expert who previously worked with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  There were nine coal-fired plants in the works across the state with 19 already in operation.

No new fawns were found among 76 white-tailed deer in a 30-mile area in the Panhandle.  In the same area, only 3 quail were seen, where biologists would normally find 15.  Deer were dying from inadequate water supplies in South Texas, where 20 dead adult deer were found on one ranch.  Quail were not able to reproduce this year, according to the game bird program leader for Texas Parks and Wildlife.  In the northeastern Panhandle and north central Texas, the quail population was at historic lows, with a count of just 5 in areas where 21 were usually found.  Only one quail was found in a 20-mile radius in the Hill Country where 5 or more were normally found.  Six scaled quail were seen in the Trans Pecos region of West Texas where usually 16 or more birds would be found.  The antelope population in the Trans Pecos area has been suffering from a parasite for several years that has reduced the number of antelope.  Drought will likely further reduce antelope numbers.  A survey of antelopes in the northeastern Panhandle in June and July revealed 16 fawns among the 100 does, whereas there would usually be 35 fawns, indicating a fairly high mortality rate.  Antelope, deer and mule deer bucks may not fare well this breeding season because they use lots of energy and require adequate food to recover well afterward. Does were already doing poorly, which explains the meager fawn crops, which was as low as 27 percent in parts of the Southeast and Central Texas.

More infant bats than usual were dying, suggesting that adult bats were not able to find enough food to supply themselves and their young.  The 20 million bats from the Bracken cave were coming out up to two hours before nightfall to travel greater distances to reach insects that inhabit corn and cotton plants.  The bats in Austin were emerging early, as well.  The 3 million bats in the Old Tunnel Wildlife Management Area near Fredericksburg normally take 40 to 60 minutes to fly out of the abandoned train tunnel, but presently take just six to 10 minutes to come out for the night.  The manager of the Old Tunnel Wildlife Management Area noted that the number of bats usually doubles in August as the young bats begin to fly, but the drastic change in the evening departures from the tunnel indicates that there are many fewer bats, meaning that many young probably did not survive.

32392,"Large wildfires more common in Texas, due to drought, other factors",10/30/2015,01/01/2000,10/28/2015,"Drought, development and changes in land use in Texas have encouraged the occurrence of larger, more threatening wildfires.  Nearly 80 percent of the 157,000 wildfires that burned in the state between 2006 and 2014 burned within 2 miles of a community.  The forest service responded to only one wildfire larger than 5,000 acres between 1985 and 2000, but in the last 15 years, fires of that size have occurred almost annually.  In 2008, there were 27 fires at least that big, and in 2011, there were 76 wildfires larger than 5,000 acres.  Grazing animals were present on the landscape more frequently in previous decades, reducing the amount of vegetation, but with the increase in housing and other developments, the vegetation is no longer grazed down and becomes a fire hazard.

29960,"Conservation strategies from previous droughts in California still benefiting, harming state",01/28/2014,01/01/1977,01/27/2014,"Water managers in California learned that during previous droughts some of their strategies for weathering drought led to harmful consequences, while other strategies put water systems in a better position to withstand future droughts. Measures to deal with the 1977 drought in California resulted in some of the urban water conservation activities that have made water use more efficient in the state.  The water market was established so that water can be leased, and the Legislature passed laws to aid water trading, changes which helped the state bear the 1987-92 drought with less expense related to water shortages for cities, farms and wildlife refuges.  The California Urban Water Conservation Council, a team of urban water agencies, managed demand and curbed per capita water use beyond the end of the drought.  Mitigation planning helped make cities more drought-resistant, and years later, communities have invested in groundwater storage, new surface storage in local reservoirs, wastewater recycling and desalination.  In the Bay Area, water agencies have become interconnected to share water when needed.  Large volumes of water were exported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during the 1987-92 drought, affecting the flow and salinity in the delta that encouraged the proliferation of invasive species, which contributed to the loss of delta smelt and other native fish. In spite of efforts to restore the previous balance in the delta, delta smelt and other native fish populations have not rebounded.During the 2007-09 drought, San Joaquin Valley farmers received federal grants to drill wells to supplement their water supplies. Since parts of the Valley had experienced excessive groundwater withdrawals and land subsidence, additional pumping only exacerbated the subsidence and damaged the California Aqueduct.
