No specific scientific proof but it appears that high water temps in creek is likely reducing survival of salmon fry, based on observations of Fish and Wildlife staff for the last several years. This is Likely happening in all creeks, as they have observed decreases in returns in all creeks island wide.Ocean water temps have been significantly warmer- this is impacting herring migratory behavior.  If you need additional backup, Fish and Wildlife can produce that from research done previously to demonstrate the changes in herring behavior in recent years. Water temperatures are impacting an early algal bloom which is impacting herring spawning behavior. Dive fisheries are being impacted by water temps increasing the length of toxic algal blooms, resulting in high PST level readings. This impacts the commercial Geoduck fishery and then subsistence harvest for all other shellfish. Low water in lakes is reducing available water for hydro generation, resulting in the tribe relying on diesel generation for the foreseeable future. Reduced snowpack, results in low spring recharge in hydrological systems, the result is lower lake and stream levels at the beginning of the season, which become more critically low as the drier summer progresses. This low water and warmer temperatures may be contributing to low salmon fry survival as well. Forest Health Low water levels and low rainfall, have increased the stressors on evergreen species, allowing pests such as spruce aphids to cause widespread ill health, and gradual die-off region wide.Berry bushes had high amounts berries due to the sunshine, but many late season berries were very dry and shriveled, reflecting how dry conditions were. Salmon berries were ready for harvesting in late May which was earlier than normal and we were harvesting still in August. Evergreen trees are losing their foliage.Many of the evergreen ferns that typically grow on the roadsides have been heavily impacted by low water conditions, turning brown and dying early.Temperate late fall weather has allowed an entire extra flowering cycle of some invasive species, such as, Orange Hawkweed, Tansy Ragwort, Fall Dandelion and sow thistle. Wildlife impactsHummingbirds have been known to stay year round instead of migrating south.Robins and Flickers have been returning earlier, as early as February instead of late March or early April.The increasing humpback whale population is a factor of climate change.  Before 15 years ago there were no known overwintering humpback whales in Southeast Alaska.  In the present time we can document humpbacks in AIR waters year round.  This may be the Northern most Southern overwintering ground.  Back in the day humpbacks would return to Hawaii or Mexico for winter.  Now the warmer oceans are more productive further north so the whales do not need to follow food all the way to Hawaii.The increased abundance of deer on Walden Pt Rd in early spring is contributed to climate change.  The warming temps earlier in the year is causing alder to bud out earlier.  The road systems are great places for alder to reach to the sun.

The high temperatures continued until just recently (July 28). We were also still fairly dry from low rain in 2017.  Our fescue/bermuda/clover pasture was dried up and gone by the second week in June and we started feeding hay we had left over from the winter at a rate of two bales a day. By the first of July, that hay was gone and we bought two loads of mixed grass round bales for $50/bale delivered.  We have fed hay daily and are still feeding hay.  By July 25, we were getting close to running out of hay again and started a search for more hay. None of our regular sources was able to find hay, and our internet/Facebook search could not locate any hay for sale, even in adjoining states and as far away as Nebraska. The only hay we could find was $85/bale plus hauling. After being completely out of hay for almost a week, we located mixed grass round bales within 150 miles of us that will be delivered August 1st at a cost of $80/bale delivered.  This is only two loads (68 bales), so we will be out of hay again in three weeks.

44566,"Lack of rainfall affecting livestock operation in Tehama County, California",04/09/2018,11/15/2017,04/03/2018,"Our ranch is located in northern California about 45 miles south of Redding, CA,  about 16 miles west of the I-5 corridor. Our nearest post office is Paskenta, CA.  Since our first rainfall on November 8, 2017 we have received 6.25"" of rain.  Our average for the year is around 22"". We have approximately 45 days remaining in our rainy season.        Our ranch consists of 6500 acres and has the carrying capacity, on a normal year, of 500 fall pairs for the grazing season, which consists of the months from November through mid May.  This provides 180 day season multiplied by 500 pairs equals 90,000 animal grazing days.      Our grass is O.K. at best.  To clarify, the quality is good, quantity is poor.  The rain has waited until the last possible day to arrive on every occasion thus far meaning we have had little rain, but it has arrived at just the right time to keep us going.       The drought is affecting our operation in multiple ways.      1. The first impact is our carrying capacity.   November 15 we brought in 300 fall pairs.  This is a little over half of what should have been brought in.  March 10 we brought in another 100 fall pairs and 60 spring calving cows.  This works out to: 300 pairs multiplied by 180 days equals 54,000 animal grazing days plus 100 pairs and 60 bred cows multiplied by only 60 days equals 9,600 animal grazing days for a total of 63,600 animal grazing days.  This is a 30% loss in carrying capacity.2. Rain  Runoff.  We depend on rain runoff to recharge stock ponds and to provide stream flow in seasonal creeks to provide drinking water.  We have been hauling water to one group of cows for 3 weeks.  The others will be fine for this year.3. Calf market weights.  We are projecting our market calves to be 40-70 pounds lighter due to lack of available feed and also having to sell animals sooner.  4. The greatest impact of 2017-2018 drought, in my opinion,  will be fall of 2018.  We have not received any runoff to recharge our stock ponds.  This will not allow us to graze cattle until we receive significant rain which will shorten our cattle grazing days for a second consecutive year.      The drought is really spotty in northern California.  Conditions change drastically within 30 miles of our operation; some for the better, most for the worst.       To summarize, to graze one cow for one day is $1.33  We will lose 26,400 animal grazing days this season for a loss of $35,112.  Add 400 fall pairs, which will yield 300 calves to sell weighing 560 pounds (last years average was 600 pounds) for a price of $1.50/lb equals $840.00 ($900.00 using last years weights) for a loss of $60.00 per calf multiplied by 300 equals $18,000 loss.  2018-2019 presents other potential losses with less animal grazing days.  There is a very good possibility we will not have any cattle until January 1, 2019, due to stock pond recharge,  which will be a 45-day loss of days.  45 days multiplied by 500 pairs equals 22,500 animal grazing days multiplied by $1.33 for a loss of $29,925.  This puts our total financial loss to $83,037.00, not counting losses from conception issues, lack of feed for replacements, lack of yield in hay production, etc...From Tehama County, California, on April 3, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Tehama County, CA, Paskenta, CA",

Obviously its effects are intensifying as time with no rain progresses.  We ran short on grass the end of last grazing season and what grass was there had little nutrition value.  The grass just shut itself down and browned up. We supplemented with alfalfa to get along, but at significant unexpected expense.  I'm afraid that the impacts of this dry spell are already impacting this coming year's grazing season and am preparing for such.  The other day (27 December 2017) I had a water well powered by solar panels go dry on me.  It no longer has the water capacity to keep up with the number of cattle I have in that location.  My only option, outside of moving the cattle away from the feed, was to pipe rural water to them.  Usually we can count on the wells we have.  Prior to this one going dry, we were drilling wells in pastures where our ponds are drying up with great success.  In December 2017 we drilled two wells in winter pastures where the ponds have all but dried up.  Without rain soon we will have to drill wells in summer pastures where we solely depend on ponds.This past week we received 2"" of snow, which is better than nothing.  Outside of this moisture we've had very little (maybe 2.25"" rain total) since last June.  Wheat pasture has been a fail.  We planted as usual for grazing and got about 1/2"" rain on it.

In Miles City in southeastern Montana, more older cows and replacement heifers were being sold than usual, but nothing extreme.

40864,"Cattle sales, crop loss near Herreid, South Dakota",07/10/2017,06/07/2017,06/29/2017,"We farm and ranch 7 miles west of Herreid, South Dakota and we have wheat, soybeans and corn crops and also run around 200 head of cows with calves on the side. The crops were planted on time but due to no moisture this spring in our area, some of the crops came up, but look bad and other crops haven't even come up and when we have dug down in the ground, the seed has turned black. There will be no crop! We are hoping for rain soon so we can go back into those fields and plant some sort of feed source for our cattle. Due to the dry conditions, for the past month, we have been sorting through our herd and picking off cow/calf pairs to sell due to the lack of grass for the summer. We had a very hard winter and our feed supply is very low and with no corn crop, we will be looking for some type of feed for the cows or we are considering sending our cows away for the winter, just so we can keep the younger portion of our herd. My husband and I have been married for close to 31 years this fall and we went through one drought in 2006 and it was one of the hardest things we have gone through, and especially for me. We started our own herd by buying some registered Simmental cows and most of our herd is home raised, and yes, this old farm lady gets quite attached to her cows. In 2006, we had to sell 75 pairs and I can still remember the day the semis came into the yard to take those mama cows and their babies to the sales barn. I cried and cried! Now, we are experiencing the same thing! We have sold 20 pairs so far and will be selling 18 more pairs tomorrow. Yes, I always watch our animals in the sale ring and yes, I'm not ashamed to say, the tears flow down my face as they sell as this is a hard situation as it isn't something we have done wrong, but God and Mother Nature at work.  We have seen news stories from Aberdeen, SD and Bismarck, ND where the trucks and trailers are lined up for a long distance as they wait to drop off their pairs at the local sales barn. I have a feeling it will be happening in our local sales barns this week also!  The crops and cattle is the livelihood for these farmers and ranchers and some have been in the business for years and others are just beginning. What a hardship this will be for all farmers and ranchers as not only do they not have a crop for market, they will have no cattle to sell when they usually do to pay off the operating loans, etc. People in our country need to realize that these farmers and ranchers who bust their you know what day after day, is what keeps food on their tables. It does not magically appear at the grocery stores!  The sad part is that our son, who is 20 years old, just graduated from college with an Agronomy degree and he plans to work for awhile, which he is doing, but in the future, he would like to take over the family farm and he would be the 4th generation to run this operation. This situation is scaring him as he realizes how quickly things can go the other way. We need more of these family farms and ranches instead of the big operations as this is what life is all about to give the legacy down to the next generation. My husband and I just want the government, people, etc. to know what our situations are as every day is full of work and worry. There have been many sleepless night staying up and talking and figuring out what we are going to do as this was not the plan for this year. Yes, we chose this as our job, but why is it when other states have a storm disaster or whatever, it is immediately blown out of proportion by the media, but ""never"" do we hear anything about when something like this happens in the Dakotas.

The U.S. Drought Monitor Index shows yellow drought conditions exist as close as just 8 to 10 miles north of us. They exist to the east of us as well, about 30 miles away.  Drought conditions are several counties to the south. The plants are making slow comebacks from the freeze, without help from the rains.  We had over four inches of rain in four days, over two nights.  Both nights had electrical style storms in that along with heavy rain at times, the lightening was almost constant for hours on end. Even during the overnight hours. That rain was needed and mostly soaked in, yet it has not done much.  River levels are so low, you cannot kayak or canoe down the rivers in White Springs, Florida (20 minutes to our northeast).  You can walk along the river bottom.  That usually does not happen until late July through September if at all, unless a tropical system comes visiting.  The smog in the air is increasing.  Wildfires are increasing in amount and intensity. A prescribed burn recently was taken out of control by the wind and dry conditions. A newcomer to the area near Jacksonville, Florida (east of this location) was burning books, limbs, and other things outside his newly rented mobile home (laying on the ground, no pit dug or brick circle), and started the worst wildfire the area has seen in over 20 years.

Part of the discrepancy was due to most of the sidewalk segment joints were well sealed between the cracks.

This morning I tossed the 50-square inch inner diameter hollow ring onto a muddy area of a ditch bottom from more than five feet away and photographed then examined the benthic surface image with a magnified computer photo viewer.  Digging, disturbing lifeforms or removing things from the ditch is against the rules. There was stagnant water in the same ditch both upstream and downstream of the sample site. Within the 50 square inches, I counted 18 small brown and green leaves or leaf fragments less than two inches long, and more than 20 fresh, short, light-green grass blade sprouts. Some of the fresh green growths from the damp ditch bottom had wider shoot-like leaves. Approximately 12 or fewer square inches of the bottom surface was covered in a darker jungle-green shade of slimy looking algae mats. At least five small heaps of dark brown dirt/sand with circumference of 0.5 inch or less and less than one inch tall were spread around within the sampled area.  Other items in the water include more than three balls, two bivalve shells, several drink containers, and various twigs, branches and log pieces that are not able to float on down the stream due to shallow water.  I saw the first small minnow of 2017 with his head pointed towards upstream but not moving forward through the clear shallow water beneath the footbridge on a sunny day earlier this week. I saw concentrated populations of 20 or more turtles near different water bodies (mostly out of the water on logs or concrete drain pipes) this week. I can also hear but have not seen what sounds like large populations of aquatic frogs with higher/moderate toned (not bullfrogs) loud fast group croaking concentrated in the same soggy areas during certain conditions.

Most of our moisture has been due to fog. Need to water the roses. Spring has come early to this region, though there could easily be at least one more freeze before it really is spring.  Have seen this pattern play out before where people plant entire gardens thinking the warmer weather is here to stay just to get it destroyed by a freeze.  The redbud trees are blooming, plants are budding out, birds are returning to, and going through, the area (mainly through). This will be added stressors to an area near the beginnings of a drought.  The Drought Monitor Index shows the second level drought we were in has totally vanished.  Have observed many people watering the sidewalk instead of just the lawn and plants, as well as watering between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This area is seeing more sinkholes opening up.  One of the causes of these is the over-withdrawal of groundwater (different than surface water). Drought is also a part of this.  However, the currently forming sinkholes may, in part, be caused by the pipeline being forced through our area against our will.  Porous rock is not the place to be putting pipelines.  The general public show no sign of being aware we had been in a drought. Our tap water has been brown more often than it used to be since the last freeze when we had to run outside water and is also smelly.

Smoke from Mt. Fires that have been going for over two weeks due to a new record 41 days without rain after a dry year already. In 1886, 130 years ago we had 40 days without rain. We now have a new terrible record of 41 days without rain and even with a cold front showing rain approaching, the dry air is expected by experts to evaporate any chance of any getting to us but there is hope in the mountains with snow forecast for tonight. That would help put out the wildfires. Many local brush fires and calls for water conservation. Most ponds are gone without natural springs feeding them. Lake levels are down considerably and even the Yadkin Pee Dee is finally receding some. This hasn't happened in over a decade. Animals not often seen are coming out even in daylight to get food and water in suburban and urban areas, such as raccoons, skunks, and opossums. I buried a opossum yesterday. Farmers with stock to feed have little or no hay, straw, grass or anything left to give them. Some are selling stock or moving elsewhere. There is no national coverage although local Charlotte stations have been reporting this for quite sometime. I have science degrees in Meteorology, Geography and Earth and Space Science and see the need to spread word of what is happening in western North Carolina. Yards, gardens, and trees without irrigation are hurting. Now about 8"" below normal for 2016 in an area that get about 43"" a year that's a lot with and 1/2 months to go. Water quality is soon to be felt with the Yadkin going down, tourism from fishing and other activities are just about gone with red flag warnings and no dissolved oxygen in local lakes. Health out in the counties with water tables dropping and no rain for 41 days is at dangerous and desperate levels.

Keeping the bird baths from evaporating is difficult and when home during weekends can make sure as the water (reclaimed/gray) has drawn out many birds from the woods that I normally do not see so close to house.  Rowing out a Lake Purdy (reservoir which provides water for my county) continues to be a challenge as water levels continue to drop.  I understand it is now impossible to launch the eight-person shell but quads, doubles and singles are still possible.

Peanuts grow in the ground and have to be dug up; usually this is not very hard or very costly but this year with it being so dry it has been very challenging. The ground has been so hard we were forced to dig peanuts at night because the soil moisture rises at night ( 2 a.m. until daylight); this is the only time of day the plows would go in the ground. Having to work all night and then all day the next day gets old fast. Especially for six weeks straight. Also it took an excessive amount of peanut blades. These are the things that run in the ground to dig the peanuts up. A typical year one set of blades will run a day and a half before needing to be changed. This year with the ground being so hard it took about three sets per day. One  set is about 135 dollars so it was taking about fifteen dollars per acre in blades just to dig them. Usually a typical year it takes two dollars per acre. Plus it takes about 45 minutes to change them so it costs a lot of extra time. I also have cows. With the dry summer we had, our hay crop was very short. Added in with this extremely dry fall where we have not been able to plant any winter grazing for the cows. Some extremely hard times are coming. Typically we plant winter grazing in October and start grazing around the last week of November. Well this year it's the middle of November and we haven't even planted any grazing because the ground is hard and we can't work the land to prepare it. This has caused me to have to feed extra hay which is already in very short supply. At the rate I'm going now I will run out of hay by the first of the year so I will have buy more hay.

Winter grazing can only be established under irrigation. Water supply currently is reaching low levels. Some wells are being affected. Losses of hay range from 45% to 100%. The county average of hay loss due to drought is 55%-60%. The worst areas in the county went through half of May and all of June and July without rainfall. This is where one farmer didn't have hay to cut. Nonirrigated peanuts performed very poor this year which also negatively impacted the amount of hay growers get from peanuts. According to soil moisture data gathered from the southeastern watershed research laboratory, soil moisture at a 12-inch profile was down for a period of 2 months and didn't recover even with rain events. September and October were also particularly dry months with little to no rainfall, except for a hurricane at the beginning of September.From a University of Georgia extension agent in Turner County, Georgia, on October 28, 2016","Agriculture, Water Supply & Quality","Turner County, GA, Ashburn, GA",

Grass grew very little this spring, resulting in no hay production and poor grazing conditions.  Both of these conditions will result in lower calf weights this fall, which will result in decreased income from lower calf income and increased expense because ranchers will have to purchase winter feed that they normally would have raised themselves.The lower income and higher expenses will hurt the local economy because the main industry in our area is agriculture and specifically cattle ranching.  This will hurt the local hardware, grocery and gas stations because there will be less money to spend so these business will sell less items.The last time we had rain that made the ground muddy at my place 3 miles west of Buffalo SD was May 10, 2016.  We have had a couple of little showers but any more you can see moisture coming on radar and it will dissipate into nothing.  It is like it is so dry that it evaporates the moisture out of the storms and we receive no much-needed moisture.With the conditions that we have, fire is a real danger.  It is so dry that if a fire ever started it would be impossible to stop till there was some rain.  Usually there is some green in low-lying areas that would slow a fire down but there is none of that this year.

I have 25 acres of bermuda grass usually dedicated to hay production with an additional 20 acres that I cut for hay 1-2 times a year according to how much grazing the herd needs. From this acreage I typically produce 250-300 round bales of hay. This year I did not harvest any hay from this 45 acres as I was forced to use it for grazing to make up for the lack of growth in my pastures. I did plant 22 acres of millet (summer annual crop) and produced 54 bales of hay from it hoping to supplement my winter feeding supply. These 54 bales were fed during the month of August because I had very little grazing available, leaving me with no hay production for the winter.I typically overseed pastures and plant winter grazing (rye, ryegrass, oats, etc.) on around 75 acres and typically have grazing ready for my cattle around December 1. As of now I have planted 90 acres in winter grazing, part of it under irrigation (on land that I rent out for row crop). I have not been able to overseed my pastures because of the lack of moisture. The irrigated winter grazing is doing well and will provide grazing, but not enough to carry the herd. The non-irrigated grazing did germinate but is growing poorly and appears to be dying. I have been able to purchase 180 bales of hay and will have to purchase at least another 100 bales if I am able to find hay to purchase to carry my herd through the winter.If the weather pattern continues as predicted I feel that I will most likely lose stands of grass in my pasture field and hay fields and will be forced to replant in order to have the production I need.From an agricultural producer in Washington County, Georgia, on November 17, 2016",Agriculture,"Washington County, GA, Harrison, GA",

Jerry Brown, is the order of the day.  With the reduction in outdoor water use has come a neglect for trees that has killed millions of them statewide.  Stressed and wilting from water loss, numerous redwoods, oaks, magnolias and other species of trees have been losing leaves and limbs, according to arborists.Water utilities have lost more than half a billion dollars in just the last eight months as customers conserve water, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.   The drop in revenue should continue through October, due to the board’s extension of the water conservation targets, and will likely lead to water rate increases as some districts work to balance the loss.  Intense water conservation has also led to other problems, too.  Sewer lines designed to carry away solid waste using about 120 gallons per household per day have only had a flow of about 50 gallons per person per day, leaving solids sitting in pipes.  As the material lingers, it gives off hydrogen sulfide and also corrodes the pipes.With the intention of saving water, Californians dutifully replaced lawns with desert-themed foliage, aided by rebates offered by their water districts, but homeowners were unaware that the Internal Revenue Service would tax the rebates as income.

The Water Resources Control Board, however, voted for modest adjustments to the conservation mandates, giving relief to hot areas like the Southern California desert and the Central Valley, but offering no change for most Bay Area cities, Los Angeles and San Diego through May.   Whereas the previous drought rules required a savings of 25 percent compared to water use in 2013, the modified rules require conservation of 23 percent compared to 2013.

The weather being what seems overall to be dry on more days, we have had some heavy rainfall (>2-3 inch) making our rainfall totals look good, but they are over fewer days.  We had gone several long stretches. This is what I think has impacted crop yields here. But having more dry days has helped the construction industry get some of the road projects cleared up and they had many damaged roads from rain/ice from the last two winters in this area. We are going into the winter with many of the roads finally repaired.

The governors of Washington, Oregon and Idaho called up state National Guard troops backed by military aircraft to fight the immense infernos.  The New York Times, Aug. 21, 2015Two hundred U.S. Army soldiers from Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Wash. were called to assist civilian firefighters battling dozens of major wildfires, blazing largely out of control in the drought-stricken West.  The soldiers will all be assigned to the same fire, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.  Fire managers requested the mobilization, the first since 2006, as fire crews from federal, state and local agencies were stretched exceedingly thin, trying to contain wildfires that have blackened more than 1 million acres across the parched West during a heat wave.  More than 29,000 civilian firefighters were already deployed in the West.  Most property losses occurred in Idaho, Oregon and Washington, with the loss of 108 homes in those states since Aug. 14. More ground crews and aircraft were requested to help with the Clearwater Fire in Idaho on Aug. 17, said a spokesman for the Clearwater command.  The request was returned for the third consecutive day marked “UTF,” meaning “unable to fill” because manpower was lacking, due to the multitude of fires.  There were about 95 blazes in seven Western states.

Except for a single 3.5"" rain in the first part of September, little has fallen since July.  The lake that we live on is very low.  Checking the gauge (0.84) at the river outlet from the lake, it is as low as I have seen in the last 30 years, with estimated flow of 40 cfs.  This may be the end of the wet cycle that started in our region in 1993, which raised annual rainfall by 20% or more.  Restrictions on use of the lake is starting to occur, if only for the underwater obstacles that are within reach of outboard props with the resulting damage if hit.  The inlet to the lake has very low flows, and warm weather this fall has contributed to extra evaporation from the lake.  September has tied for the record average high temperature in our region, being at least 6 F above average.Harvesting of crops have benefited from the dry weather, as even the corn harvest is high quality without the need for (much) drying of product before storage in bins.  So harvest is way ahead of schedule with crops representing above average yield.  The record rains in May which replenished the subsoil after an early planting in April have contributed to exceptional crops in some locations.  Now, with the lack of rain, subsoil moisture has been depleted, so farmers will need precipitation between now and next spring.With the low river flow, little water will move downstream for the City of Fargo, North Dakota use for drinking water over the winter.

This area was marked as in severe drought, which would correspond to conditions in the Salmon Tract that we moved to a severe drought categorization last week.  Irrigation on the Salmon Tract shut down in mid-July.  Yesterday, I was up in the Big Lost River Basin north of Arco and the reservoir is still half full.  This region is also labeled as in severe drought.  The half-full reservoir is completely counter-intuitive since the reservoir only holds a years worth of irrigation storage.  Runoff at the Howell gage (above the reservoir with 66-years of monthly statistics) indicates an inflow at the 28th percentile while last year was at the 9th percentile.  The reservoir typically can only hold one year’s supply of irrigation water. When we asked locals, why the reservoir was in such good shape, they indicated that it was due to more users relying on groundwater withdrawals.  Many of the users have both groundwater and surface water sources.  Drought impacts to crops are thus nil.  The impact of drought this season will be hidden underground.  The Big Lost River basin suffers serious problems with regard to groundwater declines, and is a major source of tributary underflow to the declining East Snake Plain Aquifer.  The only benefit to storing water in the reservoir from a mass-balance perspective, is the chance that an abundant water supply next year will result in an opportunity for managed aquifer recharge.  Otherwise, storing the water, means less incidental recharge opportunities this year.  In my consideration a severe drought categorization even without visible impacts in this basin is completely reasonable. I’ve shown arrows on the map below to indicate locations of the irrigation companies and districts referred to above.From technical hydrologist David Hoekema on August 5, 2015.","Agriculture, Relief, Response & Restrictions, Water Supply & Quality","Ada County, ID, Boise, ID, Butte County, ID, Arco, ID",

Other reservoirs were still sorely in need of more precipitation.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 6, 2016The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released an average of 3,000 acre-feet of water daily from Folsom Lake through August, but will slow the releases to 800 cubic feet per second by the morning of Sept. 4.  As of noon on Aug. 31, Folsom Lake held roughly 196,000 acre-feet of water.  The higher releases during August were to keep saltwater from pushing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and to retain more cold water in Lake Shasta for an endangered species of salmon.  With the smaller releases in September, Reclamation intended to “conserve water in storage,” and keep Folsom Lake above 120,000 acre-feet so the pumping infrastructure for suburban Sacramento would continue to work.  Reclamation was constructing a specially outfitted barge that could pump water to the city of Folsom if the lake were to fall below the city’s intake valves.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 31, 2015Folsom Lake will be drawn down more slowly this summer to ease the concern of Sacramento-area water agencies worried about the water supply.  The lake will likely dwindle down to 120,000 acre-feet at the end of September, but will not be allowed to drop further.  Water officials in the region worry that the valves that deliver water would not work at that level.To slow the drain of water from Folsom Lake, more water will be taken from Lake Oroville, one of the reservoirs in the Central Valley Project.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), July 7, 2015","Relief, Response & Restrictions, Society & Public Health, Water Supply & Quality","Butte County, CA, El Dorado County, CA, Placer County, CA, Sacramento County, CA, Sacramento, CA",

What was supposed to be a good chance for a heavy winter with El Niño conditions did not pan out in the central and southern part of the state, and even the north was so warm during the winter that snow pack did not develop properly but melted off a great deal, especially in March.  We have not fully recovered from the extreme drought years of 2011 and 2012, and if this is an example of a ""wet"" year, we may not ever fully recover from drought, but always have it as our background condition. We just lose what moisture we do get so quickly in terms of surface flow and soil moisture, and the deep ground water supplies are not being recharged, on the contrary, they are being sought out for pumping on a continuous basis. Crops require daily or twice daily watering now as soil moisture is very difficult to maintain. Native trees continue to suffer from lack of deep moisture, even as they put on a flush of new growth and set seed for the fist time in five or six years.  Wildlife numbers have not recovered except in the rodent and lagomorph categories, which will help spur the meso-predators in the near future.  People are starting to suffer the ills of dry air and heat with lack of energy and focus; and dry skin, eyes, and nasal passages.  Water supplies are peaking now, but will taper off this summer as the meager winter supplies are used up.  The monsoon season may bring some relief, but along with increased heat and solar radiation, any summer moisture is usually off set by this incremental increase in drought conditions.

This tributary of the Santa Ana River between Corona and Riverside dwindles to a trickle because the water table has fallen so low from drought that the output from the plant comprises the main flow in the stream, leaving fish high and dry during maintenance.  Volunteers and employees from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service come prepared to collect the fish in buckets of water to keep them alive for a few hours until plant operation resumes, and the fish are released back into the stream.  Inevitably, some of the fish perish despite the best efforts to protect them.  On Feb. 23, at least 81 Santa Ana suckers died before they could be rescued.  Law enforcement authorities took possession of the dead fish and started an investigation into the case.The Clean Water Act requires the plant to perform the maintenance, yet the Endangered Species Act requires that the water flows continuously, putting the San Bernardino MWD in a no win situation, apart from undertaking an expensive plant upgrade.

Those affected are mainly farmers and large irrigation districts, but the city of Sacramento also must stop taking water from the Sacramento River because the city has junior water rights, although it has senior water rights for the American River.  Similar water cuts were last ordered in 1977.Members of the Colusa Drain Mutual Water Co. were warned to expect no water this year, leading growers to plant crops that could be watered using only alternate water sources, such as groundwater or other surface water supplies.

Watering any given one for even a 5-10 minute period only suffices to keep the plant from wilting for 2-3 hours.Because of our reduced rainfall, the fact that we have a shallow well (17' to the waterline in 2013, 47' to bottom of well, 30"" diameter well pipe), that it only takes 4-5 hours of heavy pumping with the household 1/2 hp submersible pump to pump it dry, and the fact that we have no substantial rainfall prediction in our outlook, I decided to let the plants die. Our muscadine grape vines are shedding 1/2""-sized grapes in quantity, and I can't seem to apply enough water to stop them from shedding.  Our 20 peach trees are shedding peaches, beyond normal ""June drop"" rates.  Peaches are only 1""-1 1/4""-sized, well below the size they should be in early July.  Our black walnut tree is shedding 1""-sized black walnuts at a rate we've never seen before in the 39 years we've lived here.  My lemon queen sunflowers haven't produced seed heads of the normal size for early July, and aren't growing at all, now.  Today, I will stop watering them, too.  My drought-tolerant black-eyed-susans are already dried and dying.  This is the earliest I've ever seen them die back.  My garden, consisting of yellow squash, tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers, pumpkin, and Swiss chard is done.  I haven't picked a single tomato or pepper, and unless we get rain, I won't.  I've watered it every day, only skipping those few days we get rain. I harvested chard twice, and picked a dozen yellow squash.  That was all.  Half of the garden isn't even in the afternoon sun, but I still can't keep it watered.  Again, a first ever.  It's like the ground won't hold water, despite the high content of organic material.We started the year with the greatest extent of St Augustine grass we've ever had, but it's dying wherever it doesn't get near full-time shade.  The centipede grass part of the yard will probably die next since I've quit watering.  Large patches of the bahiagrass part of the yard are brown and appear dead. Few if any trees haven't lost leaves, of the 60+ species we've managed to grow on our 1.44 acres.  I fear that we'll have no pecan harvest to speak of since I can find only a few small pecans on the lower limbs of the 6.5 trees (we share one planted on the property line with a neighbor) we own.  Between the drought and the heavy tent caterpillar infestation we always experience in dry years, we will likely have either a reduced harvest, or no harvest at all again, this year.  We sold only 80 pounds of pecans, last year, down from 600 +/- in an average year. Why, we don't know, but no one in our region produced pecans at a better rate. This year, frankly, I expect none.The impact on birds and small animals like the hispid cotton rats, grey squirrels, and woodland voles in the brush pile I  maintain is already forcing them into our barn to search for food.  I've had to bring our pet pig's and dog's food inside the house to keep the small animals from gnawing through the heavy-gauge plastic storage containers.

Rainfall in September 2013 spurred the growth of the Russian thistles, which grew well with little moisture in places where much of the native vegetation was sparse or had died from the drought.  There were also fewer cattle in many areas as drought led ranchers to sell livestock, leaving fewer ruminants to nibble on the Russian thistle shoots.  The tumbleweeds are abundant in many areas, blocking roads and drainage culverts and piling up against fences and homes.In Fountain, Colorado, just southeast of Colorado Springs, a windstorm blew an incredible number of tumbleweeds into town, building mounds more than 10 feet high that residents strove to rake together and bag to get rid of them.An older couple in Clovis, New Mexico was trapped in their home in January when it became engulfed in tumbleweeds.  ""I looked out the window to see why it got so dark all of a sudden, and they were over 12-feet high, blocking my front and back doors,"" the man said.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation upped its water allocations for Roseville, making the surcharge unnecessary.  The city did allow underutilized parks and fields go dormant, according to the city’s water efficiency administrator.  Roseville nearly met the governor’s goal of 20 percent water conservation by reducing its water use by 19.4 percent compared with 2013.Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Jan 22, 2015The Roseville water utility said on June 2 that it will begin tacking on a drought surcharge equaling 15 percent of the monthly water usage charge starting June 15.  The temporary fee will be assessed to commercial and residential water customers and should amount to an average of $1 to $2 for most residential customers.  The city’s environmental utilities director said the fee was needed to balance the utility’s finances because drought conditions have brought higher operational costs, while requests for a 20 percent reduction in water use have dropped the utility’s revenue.Lower revenues and higher costs for outreach, staff and operational expenses have resulted in a projected deficit of $660,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30.  The drought surcharge should bring in $110,000 to offset the shortfall.  The remainder of the deficit will be covered with the utility’s $1 million rate stabilization reserve fund.

30861,Drought hurting California almond growers,09/15/2014,01/01/2014,12/31/2014,"The drought has presented serious challenges to California almond farmers who must find water for their trees and have resorted to drilling new wells, depending on salty groundwater or bulldozing trees.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service and California agriculture officials sent surveys to 688 almond growers, 458 of whom filled out and returned the surveys.Survey results showed that almost 70 percent of almond growers have only groundwater to use for irrigation this year—no surface water or canal water.  Roughly 23 percent drilled new wells, an expensive option, while 32 percent improved existing wells.  Nearly 75 percent of almond growers are using groundwater with a higher salt content than is recommended for almond trees.  Growers often try to use groundwater and less salty surface water, but this year, there is no surface water to be had.  Salt can accumulate in almond trees and harm or kill them.  Almond trees suffering from salt build-up often see smaller nut size, reduced growth and the potential for smaller than usual crops in future years.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast a 2.1 billion pound almond harvest in California this year, but the survey revealed that 9 percent of growers bulldozed trees for lack of water or suitable water.  Many almond growers cut back their acreage as well.  Growers with at least 600 acres reduced their operations by 17 percent.  Overall, California almond growers eliminated 38 percent of their acreage.  Almonds are one of the largest crops in California, covering 860,000 acres mostly in the San Joaquin Valley.

The signs of drought in 2013 are very subtle in many cases.  The tulips this year were not more than one foot tall compared with 18 inches last year.  The blanket flowers are thin stalks above a cluster of leaves rather than bushy plants like last year.  The Asiatic lilies in bloom are a little over one foot tall not over two feet tall like last year.  The purple cone flowers are about 18 inches tall rather than over 3 feet like last year.  The strange winter and spring had an effect, but the drought impact has become obvious.  Trees budded and bloomed later than usual.  The number of blossoms were reduced.  But after the leaves came out I could see the damage to my young maple tree as well as to other trees in the neighborhood.  The top half of the tree had winter killed, but that wasn't obvious until the leaves came out.  Other trees had winter damage especially near the tops. As I drive around it is easy to see which trees are most susceptible such as aspen, cottonwoods, ash, elms, and maples.  Blue spruce have either made it or not, I have not seen partial damage.  The trees that have consistently survived are the lindens once they are established.  Newly planted lindens are touch and go as can be seen near the Aurora government center on Alameda.  Some oaks look good, like the gamble oak and burr oak in my yard while I have seen others with a lot of dead branch tips.

In cases where debris falls into the cracks, a heavy rain can cause the debris to swell and push the basement walls inward.

Much of our yard is now covered in dead, brown leaves, making it look like its fall all over again.  Anytime a strong gust of wind comes through, a bunch of leaves come tumbling down from the tree.  And lastly, hydrology.  The Vermillion River is Pontiac's primary source of water.  The river has fallen to a very low level.  There is very little flow going on within the river, making the surface of the river very green looking.  Beneath the dam, the water levels are much lower.  Much of the river bed on that side has dried up.  Only a small portion towards the middle of the river bed still has flowing water in it.  The rest, is dry land.  Where there is water on that side of the river, you can still see the river bed, indicating that it is very shallow.  We need some significant rain soon.  I have never seen the river this low before ever since I've lived here.  I will post new drought impacts toward mid-month.

The flow of the river is also very low, leading to chemical and algae buildup at the surface of the water, making our river green-looking and stagnant.  These effects will likely continue to worsen until we can receive some relieving rainfall.  I will be reporting another drought impact report at the end of this month.

Car washes and the City pool are shut down, and residents are prohibited from watering grass and washing cars.   The shortage is caused by a drop in pumping water levels in the wells due to the prolonged drought.   This is not a local situation and is being seen in many parts of the State at this time.   In the City of Warrenton, the lowering of the pumping levels has caused the pumping equipment in Well 6 to break suction as the water level is dropping below the inlet to the pump, leaving it out of water.   The resulting surging of the well pump is damaging to the equipment, often resulting in broken shafting, cavitation of the impellers in the pump, and most importantly, loss of production at a critical time when capacity is most needed.From Steve McIntosh, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Jefferson City, Missouri, on July 12, 2012; excerpt from a request for approval to help alleviate a water shortage in Warrenton, Missouri","Relief, Response & Restrictions, Water Supply & Quality","Warrenton, MO",

Warmer, dryer winter.  Only moved snow three times last winter.  Rainfall amounts low, particularly since May 2012.  Lawn has been dry and brown since mid to late June.  My last normal mow of the lawn was June 8, 2012.  I mowed yesterday July 19 to clean up weeds and several areas where soil moisture is higher.  These are the driest conditions that I have ever seen.  We mowed our front, back, and south pastures (about 9 acres) in early June.  Significantly less growth than normal.  We typically mow the pastures three to four times during the season.  At this point, we don't expect to mow again this season.  We have six horses that are still feeding off the pastures.  We are supplementing grain and small amounts of hay.  Concerned that we will need to start feeding hay soon.  Our first stock of hay came with the second cut in late June.  We buy the hay right off the rack as it is bailed.  Hay price was up about 15% over last cut from last season.  Quality of hay was impacted by lack of water.  Rest of our winter stock will come from the next cut.  We are concerned about getting enough with possibility of feeding hay early and the additional cost.  We may have to up our boarding fees if feed costs go up.Water supply and the well is still good with no water restrictions or issues at this time.

28569,"Newcastle, Wyoming, increased cost of hay, increase in wildfires, early selling of livestock due to lack of food",05/29/2013,04/01/2012,08/14/2012,"My family ranches on the west end of South Dakota and I work for the Department of Agriculture in eastern Wyoming.  At our office we have seen the effects of the drought on everyone who comes through our door.  Ranchers started selling yearling cattle in May which they normally would have kept till October or November.  Across most of our county the grass may have greened up right away in the spring but never grew more than an inch or two before withering up. The only feed that most ranchers have had for their livestock this summer has been the reserve grass that was left in the pastures after last year.  There is very little hay to be baled and some of it has such high nitrate concentrations that it cannot be fed to livestock even if you do cut it.  One producer stated he has baled less than 300 bales when he normally would have over 3500 bales.  Other producers have stated that they started and finished haying at least a month before they normally would have started haying.  People are even commenting about the prickly pear cactus drying up and dying.  The drought conditions have also added to the wildfire danger in our area.  We have had fires that started from simple things - like a man hitting a rock while mowing his lawn.  That fire burned over 400 acres and several structures and homes before they could stop it.  Another fire, started by downed power lines, spread over 30,000 acres in a 24 hour period with a final total of over 63,000 acres.  These fires have threatened our towns and taken what little grass was left on the ground.  Local ranchers have also lost quite a few cattle and horses because the fires spread so fast they were unable to get them out. Gates were opened and fences cut but they still were unable to outrun the flames. Many of the cattle that did survive the fire had to be put down due to injuries caused by it.  I've seen cattle unable to nurse their newborn calves because they suffered burned bags and others unable to walk because of burned feet.  Anyone who believes ranchers don't care about their cattle should have to talk to one of these guys.  I have no idea how many wild animals have perished in the fires but I have seen how they have had to move into the fields and pastures trying to find feed.  200 head of elk can destroy a field in a matter of hours.I work at the Farm Service Agency which helps ranchers and farmers.  Every day we get calls or visits from local people who are trying to decide if they will be able to find hay for their cattle and even if they can afford the hay if they do find it.  Prices have shot up from $65-$80 per ton last year to $150-$250 (or more) per ton this year. People are traveling as far as Canada to find hay with the shipping costing more than the hay itself. The highest I've heard of was $400 per ton, delivered.  Many cattle have already been sold with some producers selling their entire herd and hoping they will be able to buy back in next spring.  These are herds of cattle that have been carefully bred and culled for years.  Other ranchers have decided to sell their ranches - these are 3rd or 4th generation ranchers on the same place their grandfathers and great grandfathers settled over 100 years ago but after 9 of the last 10 years of drought they are unable to keep going. We have received a little rain lately.  Most of it has been scattered showers that only affect small areas with a few good rains that mostly come so fast the water runs off rather than soaks in.  And even though we're getting rain that doesn't mean we are out of the woods yet.  The grasses will probably not green up - they are done for the year.  Most of our hay comes from the cool season grasses that grow in the spring so there isn't much chance of anything coming yet this fall.  Hopefully it will slow down the fires but it's already too late for most of the ranchers around here.  We will continue to see cattle sold as most of us try to hang on to our herds as long as possible but still keep what grass and hay we can for our main herd to make it through the winter.

So we have been keeping a big wash tub filled with water each night out in the back yard. Some nights we see a dozen or more deer come in to drink. Don't laugh, but I built steps for the possums, and have bricks inside the tub in case someone falls in. We have had a plethora of dragonflies this year - maybe because the watering holes are few and far between, so the mosquito population concentrates around our watering areas. The corn crop was pretty bad, but the tomatoes and fruit trees seemed to have flourished! This may be more temperature-related, but the fall azaleas started blooming the first of July. Some of them are almost finished already. Usually they are in full bloom when school starts. The crab grass has never had a better year. Those with ""real"" lawns have nothing to mow. I have the best-looking yard in town! Go figure. There are no tomato fields here this year - used to be miles of them, but the grower went under.

25998,Closure of oyster beds along Texas Gulf Coast affecting many businesses,12/14/2011,12/14/2011, ,"The closure of the coastal oyster beds has hurt the oyster industry, putting fishermen and oyster processers and shippers out of work and cutting into area businesses’ bottom lines.  Drought conditions and the absence of fresh water flowing into the Gulf promoted the growth of red tide, which makes the oysters harmful to those who eat them, and spread a parasite called “dermo” that kills oysters.  In Port Lavaca, the effects of the closure of the oyster beds touched many businesses from gas stations to equipment suppliers to eating establishments where fishermen would be spending money, but without oysters and work, there is no demand for such things.   An oyster transport company in San Leon trucks only four to five loads of Louisiana oysters instead of the ten truckloads of that it used to ship daily.  A seafood company reported that its business was off by 80 percent and noted that other seafood businesses in Port Lavaca were faring similarly.  The owner of a Port Lavaca hardware store revealed that the closure of the oyster beds cost him about $4,000 monthly or about 25 percent of his revenue from November through April.  A fisherman in Port Lavaca said that he spent $8,000 to improve his boat, but now has no income to support his wife and five children until the beds reopen.

Ranchers rely on that snow for moisture on their crops and particularly on their hay fields.   Last year we had serious flooding and that ruined the first cutting of hay.   Then lack of rain made the second cutting less than desirable.   Flooding one month and then irrigation the next month.    Very little snow this winter is going to cause the first cutting of hay to be less than optimum and if we don't get spring rains the second cutting will be very little.     The first cutting of hay is excellent hay for cattle.   But you want the second cutting for horses.   The hay is used to feed in the winter.   So last year's lack of hay didn't affect us during this winter.    However, with the lack of snow and rain, if we get a harsh winter in 2012-2013, this lack of hay will impact us greatly and we'll have to go further and further to buy hay.   Last year we bought hay over 100 miles from home and we were able to get it at $60 a ton.

Even watering was only keeping them alive and their foliage was sparse. The garden was a disaster, no amount of watering made up for the drought conditions. Now the wheat we planted to feed calves through the winter hardly came up and what did is very stressed, therefore we will not be able to raise calves this year for butchering. Our ponds are dry and there is no water for the wildlife. Conditions are very critical for us. Even though our livelihood is not derived from the land on which we live, a large portion of it is still related to farming, as we own a farm at a different location in the county.

Major reservoirs in the area are in reasonably good shape, but stock dams in the area have gone bad or dry in one year due to the hot open winter.  Pastures without tanks are not being used or water will have to be hauled with tanker trucks.  Most dry land hay fields will not be hayed and some will be used for cattle grazing. Hay prices are going up fast.  Some ranches are selling yearlings now and pairs will follow. Pasture and dry land hay fields range from 20% to 50% of last year's yields.  Irrigated fields are reported to be about 70%.  Dusty conditions have and will continue to cause health problems in calves and colts.

The City of Houston is asking residents to voluntarily conserve water due to over 500 water main breaks across the city due to the dry grounds and shifting clay soils and has enacted stage 1 water restrictions. Numerous other cities across the state are in various stages of voluntary and mandatory water restrictions. Currently 158 jurisdictions across the state have mandatory water restrictions with 80 on voluntary. See the below link for locations: http://www.tceq.texas.gov/drinkingwater/trot/location.html The Llano River at the City of Llano is currently flowing at 3.8cfs (158cfs is normal) and is expected to run dry this week if no rain falls. The river is the only drinking water supply for the City of Llano and the City only has 60-90 days of water reserves. Stage 3 restrictions banning all outdoor watering are in place. The West Fork of the San Jacinto River at I-45 (near Conroe) was reporting .1ft of water yesterday afternoon. Fire Weather: The most extreme fire conditions SE TX has faced in decades and the result of the extended dryness was very clear this weekend with wildfires burning out of control and burning homes. We have never faced such dangerous wildfire conditions in this part of the state in modern times.

New parks have only small patches of grass, while the grassy park outside of City Hall was turned into a garden of succulents.  Some L.A. residents feel that the mission to get rid of grass has deprived children of play spaces.  One woman stated, “It’s getting to the point where kids live in apartments, and they don’t even see grass, except in magazines.  I don’t want to end up like New York or Chicago, with no grass.”In July 2013, the rebate for replacing a square foot of grass rose from $2 to $2.50 in Los Angeles to encourage even more people to forego the grass.  The rebate in Long Beach increased to $3 per square foot.  In Las Vegas, Nevada  the front yards of new developments may not be planted with new grass, and medians on the Strip are covered with synthetic turf, not real grass.  The transition began in 2003 when the Las Vegas Valley Water District offered the nation’s first turf removal program and has since paid nearly $200 million for the removal of 165.6 million square feet of grass around homes and businesses.  Once the grass has been removed from a residential yard, the amount of the rebate plus interest must be paid back to the city before the owner can have a yard of grass again.
