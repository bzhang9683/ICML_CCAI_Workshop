44566,"Lack of rainfall affecting livestock operation in Tehama County, California",04/09/2018,11/15/2017,04/03/2018,"Our ranch is located in northern California about 45 miles south of Redding, CA,  about 16 miles west of the I-5 corridor. Our nearest post office is Paskenta, CA.  Since our first rainfall on November 8, 2017 we have received 6.25"" of rain.  Our average for the year is around 22"". We have approximately 45 days remaining in our rainy season.        Our ranch consists of 6500 acres and has the carrying capacity, on a normal year, of 500 fall pairs for the grazing season, which consists of the months from November through mid May.  This provides 180 day season multiplied by 500 pairs equals 90,000 animal grazing days.      Our grass is O.K. at best.  To clarify, the quality is good, quantity is poor.  The rain has waited until the last possible day to arrive on every occasion thus far meaning we have had little rain, but it has arrived at just the right time to keep us going.       The drought is affecting our operation in multiple ways.      1. The first impact is our carrying capacity.   November 15 we brought in 300 fall pairs.  This is a little over half of what should have been brought in.  March 10 we brought in another 100 fall pairs and 60 spring calving cows.  This works out to: 300 pairs multiplied by 180 days equals 54,000 animal grazing days plus 100 pairs and 60 bred cows multiplied by only 60 days equals 9,600 animal grazing days for a total of 63,600 animal grazing days.  This is a 30% loss in carrying capacity.2. Rain  Runoff.  We depend on rain runoff to recharge stock ponds and to provide stream flow in seasonal creeks to provide drinking water.  We have been hauling water to one group of cows for 3 weeks.  The others will be fine for this year.3. Calf market weights.  We are projecting our market calves to be 40-70 pounds lighter due to lack of available feed and also having to sell animals sooner.  4. The greatest impact of 2017-2018 drought, in my opinion,  will be fall of 2018.  We have not received any runoff to recharge our stock ponds.  This will not allow us to graze cattle until we receive significant rain which will shorten our cattle grazing days for a second consecutive year.      The drought is really spotty in northern California.  Conditions change drastically within 30 miles of our operation; some for the better, most for the worst.       To summarize, to graze one cow for one day is $1.33  We will lose 26,400 animal grazing days this season for a loss of $35,112.  Add 400 fall pairs, which will yield 300 calves to sell weighing 560 pounds (last years average was 600 pounds) for a price of $1.50/lb equals $840.00 ($900.00 using last years weights) for a loss of $60.00 per calf multiplied by 300 equals $18,000 loss.  2018-2019 presents other potential losses with less animal grazing days.  There is a very good possibility we will not have any cattle until January 1, 2019, due to stock pond recharge,  which will be a 45-day loss of days.  45 days multiplied by 500 pairs equals 22,500 animal grazing days multiplied by $1.33 for a loss of $29,925.  This puts our total financial loss to $83,037.00, not counting losses from conception issues, lack of feed for replacements, lack of yield in hay production, etc...From Tehama County, California, on April 3, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Tehama County, CA, Paskenta, CA",

One of the most affected native urban trees are sycamores, often found along streams and frequently used as shade and street trees.  An insect known as the polyphagous shot hole borer beetle is expected to kill all sycamore trees if the bug cannot be stopped.  It is then expected to move on to destroy other tree species.   “Catastrophic loss of our canopy would have consequences for human health and well-being, property values, air-conditioning savings, carbon storage, the removal of pollutants from the air we breathe, and wildlife habitat,” stated Greg McPherson, a supervisory research forester with the U.S. Forest Service who has been studying the unprecedented die-off of the trees gracing Southern California’s landscape.Los Angeles Times, April 19, 2017",Plants & Wildlife,"Imperial County, CA, Los Angeles County, CA, Orange County, CA, Riverside County, CA, San Bernardino County, CA, San Diego County, CA, Ventura County, CA",

Whereas the previous drought rules required a savings of 25 percent compared to water use in 2013, the modified rules require conservation of 23 percent compared to 2013.

About 25 percent of families using private wells in the Central Valley were consuming water containing dangerous amounts of uranium.  Up to 10 percent of public water systems use raw water that contains more uranium than allowed by government safety standards.  Long-term uranium exposure can damage kidneys, increase cancer risks and cause other problems.  The average amount of uranium in the public-supply wells in the eastern San Joaquin Valley increased 17 percent from 1990 to the mid-2000s, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  Uranium enters the water supply when snowmelt picks up uranium-laden sediment before it is used to irrigate crops, which produce a weak acid that draws uranium from the sediment.    As wells are used, the contaminated water is drawn down into the ground where it eventually is pumped for use as drinking water.

Folsom Lake had fallen to a historically low level in December, but has since refilled, prompting the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to up water releases to 1,750 cubic feet per second to create “safe space” for potential winter storms that could cause flooding.  Long-standing federal guidelines state that the lake ought not to contain more than 577,000 acre-feet in early February, but at 11 a.m. on Feb. 5, Folsom Lake held 581,000 acre-feet.Folsom Lake was the only large reservoir in California to reach average storage after years of drought.  Other reservoirs were still sorely in need of more precipitation.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 6, 2016The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released an average of 3,000 acre-feet of water daily from Folsom Lake through August, but will slow the releases to 800 cubic feet per second by the morning of Sept. 4.  As of noon on Aug. 31, Folsom Lake held roughly 196,000 acre-feet of water.  The higher releases during August were to keep saltwater from pushing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and to retain more cold water in Lake Shasta for an endangered species of salmon.  With the smaller releases in September, Reclamation intended to “conserve water in storage,” and keep Folsom Lake above 120,000 acre-feet so the pumping infrastructure for suburban Sacramento would continue to work.

39127,Loggers thronging to fell California's millions of dead trees,02/07/2017,01/01/2015,02/06/2017,"Roughly 102 million dead trees in California, needing to be felled for safety’s sake, lured loggers from across the nation, looking for steady work and a good paycheck.  Loggers began arriving in 2015 as the U.S. Forest Service reported 66 million dead trees, and the estimated numbers of dead trees has continued to climb.  The employment opportunity has also led some loggers to move their families from places like Oregon and Georgia because the work will last a while.  Along with an emergency order, Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.  The California Department of Transportation set aside $11 million to get rid of the trees before they fall and impede traffic to and from Yosemite National Park or hurt a motorist.  In January, CalTrans had 30,000 trees designated for removal along State Routes 41 and 168.  The agency paid as much as $1,000 per tree and already paid about $6.5 million for the removal of about 8,000 trees.  The Forest Service and two utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, were also spending millions to get rid of the trees.

In some instances, fire crews used portable pumps that had to be carried to the water’s edge to draw water after lakes dwindled, exposing a muddy or steep lake bed.  At other times, water bodies were too shallow for a helicopter’s bucket to dip into the water to refill, spurring fire crews to be creative to get the water needed to put out a fire.Various water-conserving tactics were used in place of traditional water.  When feasible, crews set backfires to clear vegetation or used firefighting foam to smother a fire rather than spraying water on it.Water agencies were also working more closely with firefighters to make water accessible by allowing firefighters to use small area reservoirs.Portable tanks were another helpful means of getting the needed water for firefighting.  Water-tender trucks can usually carry 3,500 gallons of water, while the portable tanks can hold up to 5,000 gallons, so it can take two vehicles, which sometimes must travel long distances to bring the water, to fill a tank.Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Sept. 25, 2014","Fire, Relief, Response & Restrictions","California, El Dorado County, CA, Placer County, CA, Sacramento County, CA",

Rice growers are asked to flood their fields early or leave water on the fields longer to lengthen the wet season for migrating birds.  Participating growers receive financial incentives.Chico Enterprise Record (Calif.), Oct. 15, 2015BirdReturns, a new rescue program devised by the Nature Conservancy of California, has made bird habitat available during drought by offering money to farmers to flood their rice fields early with well water and keep the fields inundated into April 2015.  The program was developed within the past month because many historic wetlands in the Central Valley and three refuges in the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex were parched amid ongoing drought, and duck reproduction in central Canada and the Dakotas was particularly successful this spring.An aerial survey of six wildlife refuges in the Sacramento Valley complex performed in August found fewer than 10,000 ducks and 250 geese at the Sacramento and Delevan refuges, 24 ducks and no geese at Colusa, and no waterfowl at Sutter, Butte Sink and Llano Seco, which were dry.  Two million ducks, half a million geese and great numbers of shorebirds are expected to arrive during the fall and winter.  Eighty-five percent of the normal wetland habitat in the Sacramento Valley is forecast to be dry and uninviting for birds in the early winter, while 87 percent of the rice fields will be dry as well.

They suspect that Delta farmers on the 70 Delta islands are taking water that does not belong to them.  The Delta farmers have water rights that allow them to take as much of the “natural” flow as they need to grow crops, and those water rights predate the DWR’s and Reclamation’s water rights.In response, the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, a group that sympathizes with Delta landowners, has filed a formal complaint against DWR and Reclamation, charging that the agencies illegally divert water from the San Joaquin, Mokelumne, Cosumnes and Calaveras rivers, taking water to which they hold no rights.

Tests to detect contamination will be performed on groundwater near the wells, but, so far, no contamination has been detected.A review of more than 2,500 state authorizations of oil field injections uncovered the use of protected and potentially useful water aquifers to dispose of the wastewater.

The wastewater contains a mix of briny water, hydrocarbons and trace chemicals and is put into aquifers holding poor quality water that nevertheless could be treated for drinking if needed.  The water contamination, coupled with drought, has limited available potable water.

Drought and the 2003 Quantification Settlement Agreement, which changes the way the Colorado River is divvied up, led the district to find ways to free up water for urban use.  While landowners receive up to $750 per acre to fallow land and tenant farmers who rent the land often pay an average of $300 per acre to rent, landowners find it more lucrative to fallow the land, leaving tenant farmers without an income.  Also, as the land is fallowed, other jobs are lost, creating an economic ripple through the community.

30877,"Ventura County, California, poor drinking water quality, water restrictions",09/18/2014,03/15/2014,09/14/2014,"The last six months have brought only 1.13"" of rain to my area.  This area is the Boy Scout Camp Road area of Lockwood Valley in North-East Ventura County. The impact is tremendous to my property and to the wildlife.  Several varieties of wildflowers never germinated this year, or if they did, there were no blooms: penstemons (wild snapdragons), lupins, clover, goldenrod, rattlesnake weed, bladder pods, cat tails, and domestic daffodils and tulips and iris didn't sprout or bloom.  The canyon/scrub oaks produced no acorns this year, the manzanita produced no nuts.  Oddly, the pinion pines produced a very small amount of viable nuts.  I now believe that the pinions are on a two to four year cycle of nut production, and it's the quantity of nuts produced that is dependent on precipitation.  More small gray fox (kit fox?) were killed on roads last fall, than I have ever seen in the past 14 years living in this area.  Rabbit numbers have reduced tremendously, and even the coyotes are hunting in other areas, since we hear their howls rarely now.  Scrub jays and stellar jays rarely visit my property now.  My property is along the northern edge of the Day Fire's devastation, and there is still very little vegetation found in the burned out areas, despite the fact that it has been eight years since the Day Fire.  Tiny pine trees and seedlings have all perished.  There are no more one to three year old pine trees on my property.  The vegetation is so sparse that very little of my property has ground cover now.  I used to have at least some grasses (dead or alive) that provided erosion control on the exposed areas.  Now, I fear that heavy rainfall will erode most of my exposed topsoil.  Since there has been almost no regeneration of the forest destroyed by the Day Fire, it's clear that this danger exists for most of the forest land between Piru and Lockwood Valley.  About 1/3 to 1/2 of the trees killed by the day fires, but those left standing remain standing.  The fallen trees roots are termite ridden.  That seems to be the only insect thriving, other than bark beetles.  There were very very few wasps, gnats, dragonflies, butterflies, flies, june bugs and similar beetles, but no difference in scorpions, and similar desert insects.  This summer, the cicadas emerged and their chirps were deafening in the forest, but this only lasted a few weeks, then it was silent again.  There was an extreme number of bark beetles on my property last fall and this spring, and I worry that my pinions will be successfully attacked by their swarms.  In some areas of Lockwood Valley, near the TXI Plant, and along Cuddy Valley and Frazier Park's south facing mountain sides, very large sections of pinions have died.  In LV, as much as 1/3 to 1/2 of these forest areas are now dead.  This will be devastating to the wildlife and will enhance erosion in these areas in future years.  Many of the poplars planted by residents have died, seemingly by drought and insects.  They are not drought resistant.  Jeffery pines (lodgepole?) appear to be as vulnerable as the pinions.  Even the manzanita are dying, as well as a small number of juniper.  To put it bluntly, things are looking grim.  This area is transforming into a desert region, it seems.  I don't know the amount the local well water has dropped, but will find out and enter that info as well.  Extreme water conservation measures are being used.  The water on my property is unsuitable for irrigation, or drinking.  I must haul in drinking water, and I don't irrigate.  I rely on local plants for landscaping, and precipitation for irrigation.  Sadly, most perennial wild flowering plants have completely died.  The flowering plants that remain are navarretia (an annual), scarlet bugles, and two different species of sage.   That's all that remains on my property.  I hope that I will still have viable seeds of the now gone plants to germinate once good precipitation returns.

Washington Post (D.C.), April 19, 2014The California Department of Water Resources is striving to quickly install temporary dams at a cost of $25 million in three channels of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to reduce seawater intrusion from the San Francisco Bay and guard water quality.

Farmers may leave up to 500,000 acres unplanted, which is 12 percent of the principal crops grown in 2013, because they will not have sufficient water to bring the crop to harvest, according to Mike Wade, executive director of the California Farm Water Coalition.A farmer in Stanislaus County chose to plant less corn and alfalfa and sell some dairy cows to avoid having to purchase grain to feed the animals because he may lose as much as two-thirds of his usual allotment of irrigation water this year.  The farmer dislikes the reductions he has to make because he says the cuts will affect his farm through 2015.A dairyman in Turlock sold roughly a dozen replacement cattle from his herd of 900 Holstein cows to reduce his need for feed and water for his main milking herd.

30017,Drought emergency for California,04/07/2017,01/17/2014,04/07/2017,"Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. lifted the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices.  Emergency drinking water projects continue in Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne counties due to diminished groundwater supplies.Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. (Calif.), April 7, 2017Despite California entering its fourth year of drought, Gov. Jerry Brown did not feel that mandatory water restrictions were needed since the public was doing well at conserving water.  Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 6, 2015The California Water Resources Control Board was asked by the state Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to further relax water standards in coming months so that more water can be held back in reservoirs, such as Shasta, Oroville and Folsom.  Some of the consequences of reduced flows will be saltier water for farmers who pull water from sloughs and channels in the estuary and lower flows in many estuary channels and upstream rivers.Endangered species will be monitored to ensure that they are not unduly harmed by the management changes, which could be adjusted to better protect fish, if needed.Fresno Bee (Calif.), April 10, 2014The drought emergency declaration on Jan. 17 softened some environmental rules and water quality standards, allowing water that is saltier and warmer than previously permitted in rivers and estuaries.  Fishing and environmental groups worry that the water needs of cities and farms will take priority over wildlife’s water needs.KQED Public Media (San Francisco, Calif.), Jan. 20, 2014Gov. Jerry Brown of California declared a drought emergency for California and urged residents to curb their water use by at least 20 percent.

Chico Enterprise Record (Calif.), May 3, 2017Urban Californians curbed their water use by 25.1 percent in February, compared with the state’s baseline year of 2013, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.  This reflected a significant increase compared with February 2016 when the rate of savings was 11.9 percent.  “Even with a banner year for winter precipitation, Californians have continued to practice sensible conservation, with a significant drop in water use in the South Coast,” stated board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus.Overall, urban Californians have reduced their water use by 22.5 percent since mandatory conservation began in June 2015.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), April 4, 2017Urban Californians conserved 18.8 percent in November, compared with water use in Nov. 2013.  The Fresno Bee (Calif.), Jan. 4, 2017Californians conserved 19.5 percent in October, compared with water use during the same month in 2013.  The conservation rate was 1.8 percent more than during Oct. 2015 and followed the trend of a gradual increase in water use in past months, but overall, the State Water Resources Control Board was pleased with the savings.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Dec. 6, 2016Californians’ water conservation efforts in September yielded a 18.3 percent reduction in water use, compared to September 2013.  During September 2015, conservation amounted to 26.2 percent, but mandatory restrictions guided water use as the public was directed by Gov. Jerry Brown to curb water use by at least 25 percent.  Given that water use had increased by 8 percent, the State Water Resources Control Board was considering bringing back mandated water restrictions.Riverside Press-Enterprise (Calif.), Nov. 2, 2016Californians’ rate of water conservation fell for the third straight month in August to 17.7 percent, compared to 27 percent in August 2015, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.

Conservation in Southern California fell to 16.9 percent, compared to 28.2 percent in July 2015.Los Angeles Times and Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Sept. 7, 2016Water consumption was down 21.5 percent in California in June, the first month that statewide drought restrictions had been lifted.   A year earlier, Californians curbed water use by 27.5 percent, but the dip in conservation was not unexpected after water agencies were finally allowed to drop mandated conservation requiring cutbacks up to 25 percent compared with 2013, the year prior to Gov. Jerry Brown’s drought emergency declaration.  The Sacramento Bee, Aug. 2, 2016Californians cut their residential water use by 28 percent in May, compared to the same month in 2013.Redding Record Searchlight (Calif.), July 6, 2016Californians remained steadfastly conservation-minded in April as they used on average 77 gallons of water daily, a decrease of 26.1 percent compared to the 104 gallons used daily in April 2013, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.  During the past 11 months of intensive conservation, the state’s residents have saved enough water to serve 18 percent of California’s 40 million people for one year.The Washington Post, June 6, 2016In March 2016, California residents used 24.3 percent less water in March, compared with the same month in 2013.  March was cool and wet, allowing people to turn off their sprinklers and conserve more water.  The State Water Resources Control Board were revising water restrictions which will take effect in June.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), May 3, 2016Gov. Jerry Brown mandated 25 percent water conservation between June 2015 and February 2016, compared to the same months in 2013, and Californians just missed the target at 23.9 percent.

San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Jan. 5, 2016Water conservation in California dipped to 22 percent in October as warmer temperatures, compared to the benchmark year of 2013, likely led to more lawn watering.  October was also the first month that conservation fell below the mandated 25 percent since enforcement started in June.  Since June, water conservation efforts have saved an average of 27 percent per month, already putting the state at 76 percent of its conservation goal through February 2016.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Dec. 1, 2015Californians cut their water use 26 percent in September, exceeding the governor’s goal of a 25 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013 water use.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Oct. 30, 2015For the third month, Californians have exceeded the governor’s request for 25 percent water conservation and saved 27 percent in August 2015, compared to August 2013.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 1, 2015California urban water use fell 31 percent in July, compared with water use in 2013, for a savings of more than 74 billion gallons.  The 31 percent water savings well exceeds the governor’s mandate for a 25 percent reduction in water use.  Roughly 4 in 5 of the state’s about 420 water districts met the 25 percent goal in July.  Most big cities also made their conservation targets, but four water districts missed their target by more than 15 percent.As water customers use less water, utilities lose revenue when less water is sold, yet fixed costs for maintenance and operations of water delivery systems remain.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 27, 2015Californians curbed their water use in June by 27 percent, according to the State Water Resources Control Board, exceeding the governor’s demand for 25 percent water conservation.  Of the 400 individual conservation targets assigned to the state’s largest water agencies, about two-thirds successfully made their goals.  Sixteen agencies—mostly in central or southern California—missed their conservation target by more than 15 percentage points.  One small Central Valley community, ordered to cut water use by 32 percent, only lowered its water use by 3 percent.Another 71 water agencies missed their goal by 5 to 15 percentage points, while 53 water providers fell short of their target by 1 to 5 percent.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), July 30, 2015Californians’ best showing in water conservation occurred in May with a 29 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013.  The May conservation effort exceeded the governor’s April order to curb water use by 25 percent.  May rains could have influenced the conservation rate, with fewer people watering lawns.  The Sacramento area cut water use by nearly 40 percent, leading the state in water savings, while the southern coast, including Los Angeles and San Diego used 25 percent less water, an improvement over the past few months.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com)The public stepped up their water conservation efforts and used 13.5 percent less water in April compared with April 2013, an improvement over water savings of 3 percent in February and 4 percent in March.KFSN-TV ABC 30 Frenso/Visalia (Calif.), June 2, 2015Water conservation in March rose to 8.6 percent, considerably below the 25 percent mandatory cut in water use ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown.Los Angeles Times, May 5, 2015Water use in California fell less than 3 percent in February, compared to February 2013, as poor water conservation efforts raised alarm and led to mandatory targets for conservation by city, depending on the city’s per capita water use.  Along the south coast from Los Angeles to San Diego, water use was higher, indicating the need for drastic changes to water habits in light of the intense drought pummeling the state.  Statewide water conservation was about 9 percent since the governor requested a voluntary reduction in water use in January 2014.The New York Times, April 7, 2015Water use in January 2015 was 8.8 percent lower than the previous January’s, rebounding from a December 2014 conservation success of 22.2 percent, surpassing the governor’s conservation goal of 20 percent.  An exceedingly dry January likely led to some lawn watering, which may have bumped up water use.Per capita water consumption was 73 gallons in January, up from 67 gallons in December.Los Angeles Times, March 5, 2015Abundant December rainfall helped Californians cut their water use by 22 percent, allowing residents to finally bring their water conservation above the 20 percent mark as requested by Gov. Brown in January 2014.  The public has done an impressive job of lowering per capita water use in the past six months.  In June, California per capita water use was 140 gallons per day, but in December, that number was down to an average of 67 gallons per day.  Cities among  the lowest water users in December were San Diego with a per capita water use of 46 gallons per day and San Francisco with a daily use of 40 gallons per day.San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Feb. 3, 2015Statewide, water conservation climbed to 9.8 percent in November in comparison with November 2013 water use.  In the South Coast region, comprised of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties, conservation amounted to 3.2 percent, while in the Bay Area and Sacramento, water consumption was 18 and 25 percent.  Temperature differences and more rainfall in Northern California may have contributed to the range in conservation results.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Jan. 6, 2015Despite Gov. Brown’s request for conservation of 20 percent, Californians only curbed their water use by 6.7 percent in October, compared with the previous year and by 11.6 percent in August, state residents’ best showing since the appeal for conservation.  The state Water Resources Control Board said that 90 billion gallons of water have been conserved since June.  The state’s primary reservoirs held 39 percent to 60 percent of normal water levels for this time of year.  In addition, the average Northern Sierra snowpack was 79 percent of normal, while the southern Sierra was 47 percent of normal.ABC News, Dec. 3, 2014Southern Californians cut their water use by 1.4 percent in October, compared with the previous year, but some water customers used more water, according to figures from the State Water Resources Control Board.  Residents in the Costa Mesa Water District used 12.5 percent more water, with per capita water use climbing from 80 gallons per day to 90 gallons daily.  Other communities using more water included Trabuco Canyon Water District, Brea, Santa Margarita Water District, San Clemente, City of San Juan Capistrano Water Department, Moulton Niguel Water District and Anaheim.  Water districts using less water were the East Orange County Water District, where people used an average of 270 gallons of water per person daily in October for a decrease of 5.8 percent.  Newport Beach water customers used 25.7 percent less water.  La Palma and Garden Grove also trimmed their water consumption.Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Dec. 2, 2014Water conservation in California waned slightly in September, with savings of 10.3 percent or about 22 million gallons, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.  Per capita water use varied from less than 50 gallons per day up to more than 500 per day.  In Beverly Hills, usage was 286 gallons per person per day and in the East Los Angeles district of the California Water Service Co., it was 48 gallons per person per day.  Southern Californians on average used 119 gallons per person per day.Los Angeles Times, Nov. 4, 2014Californians curbed water use by 11.5 percent in August, compared with the previous year, for an increase in water savings.  Parts of Southern California made substantial progress in water conservation, from using 8 percent more water in May to using 7.8 percent less in August.  Gov. Brown urged residents to cut their water use by 20 percent, putting Californians a little more than halfway to the goal.  More water agencies are providing water use data.  In May, providing data to estimate water conservation was voluntary, with 63 percent of water agencies participating. while in August, about 95 percent shared water use figures.  The City of Tracy cut water use by 41 percent in August and was one of 20 cities trimming their water use by 20 percent.  State officials had special praise for Long Beach, which has long been working to conserve water, but still achieved a reduction in water use of 6.8 percent.  Long Beach had brought its water use down to the lowest point since 1958.Los Angeles Times, Oct. 7, 2014Despite the request for a 20 percent reduction in water use, Californians have curbed their water consumption by 7.5 percent, according to water agencies.  While some cities used more water in July in comparison with  the previous year, many cities cut their consumption in July.

Reductions in water use between northern and southern parts of the state were not always fair comparisons because some areas had already taken greater strides toward water conservation than other areas.Water conservation efforts were more apparent after the state adopted emergency conservation regulations in July.  In May, water use rose 1.5 percent; in June, water use fell 4.4 percent, but in July, water consumption fell 7.5 percent.

Treasure hunters with metal detectors have come looking for artifacts, but the state agency quickly adopted rules about their use. The remnants of Mormon Island has begun to rise from the receding waters of Folsom Lake as ongoing drought conditions drew the lake down to less than 20 percent of capacity.  Mormon Island was founded amid the mid-19th century gold rush.  People have visited the site to have a look at the emerging artifacts, such as hand-forged nails, rusted hinges and other items submerged since the lake was created in 1955.

29916,"Avila Beach, California, dusty, with dry plants, deer foraging in yards",01/13/2014,01/10/2014,01/13/2014,"At this point the only effect we feel from the drought I would say is visual.  The landscape around us is dry, dusty and desolate.  No vegetation anywhere.  The deer come through the neighborhood and nibble on things in or out of drought, but right now they’re eating things in the yards they usually don’t touch.  Like our hedge, for example, and the leaves of the Agapantha plants (usually they eat the flowers off only).  One thing I have noticed, come to think of it, is that I find an unusual amount of small debris on the ground around all the trees.  It appears to come from birds doing something in the branches or on the trunk, but I can’t figure out what.  Some patches of leaves on the oaks in the hills are dying off.  I was told it’s from the stress of no water. If the drought continues, no doubt we will have water rationing, and people on their own will refrain from new plantings in the Spring, etc. to some extent.  But like I said, so far for those of us who live in this particular area the effect is mainly visual. Whether farmers are having problems with wells, etc. I do not know.Submitted Jan. 10, 2014, by an observer in Avila Beach, California",Plants & Wildlife,"San Luis Obispo County, CA",

Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Jan. 8, 2014.Little snow has fallen in the Lake Tahoe area, leading recreationists to do more mountain biking, hiking, beach walking and sunbathing than skiing.  The mountains are largely brown, ski resorts are not fully open and the dry winter is taking a toll on local businesses’ bottom line.  Even Donner Summit has only thin patches of snow and the Donner Ski Ranch was empty.  A few skiers made their way downhill, despite the rocks and bare dirt.The lack of snow cut into business at most resorts and equipment rental shops, but many people who had planned their vacations months ago were making the best of it and skiing anyway.  The ski and board repairs needed after hitting rocks were beneficial for the local shops.  A bicycle rental shop in Truckee was busy, although the activity is not usually popular in January.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service and California agriculture officials sent surveys to 688 almond growers, 458 of whom filled out and returned the surveys.Survey results showed that almost 70 percent of almond growers have only groundwater to use for irrigation this year—no surface water or canal water.  Roughly 23 percent drilled new wells, an expensive option, while 32 percent improved existing wells.  Nearly 75 percent of almond growers are using groundwater with a higher salt content than is recommended for almond trees.  Growers often try to use groundwater and less salty surface water, but this year, there is no surface water to be had.  Salt can accumulate in almond trees and harm or kill them.  Almond trees suffering from salt build-up often see smaller nut size, reduced growth and the potential for smaller than usual crops in future years.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast a 2.1 billion pound almond harvest in California this year, but the survey revealed that 9 percent of growers bulldozed trees for lack of water or suitable water.  Many almond growers cut back their acreage as well.  Growers with at least 600 acres reduced their operations by 17 percent.  Overall, California almond growers eliminated 38 percent of their acreage.  Almonds are one of the largest crops in California, covering 860,000 acres mostly in the San Joaquin Valley.

If the company did not shift to feeding grain, for lack of pasture, the only alternative would have been to go out of business.  Without good rain in the next few months, most of their cattle will be eating grass, hay and grain, instead of just grass.A producer of organic grass-fed beef for the meat company, Belcampo, may truck 2,000 head of cattle to the Dakotas or Montana for the winter since there was inadequate grazing nearby.  The cost of scarce organic hay for the cattle is about $295 per ton, or 9 percent higher than last year, as numerous producers scramble to buy the hay.  The retail cost of the organic grass-fed beef rose by 10 percent as it became more costly and difficult to maintain the grass-fed business model, but the owner is determined to stick with it.

Growers of certified seed in northeastern Colorado have received requests for seed from southeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and the panhandles of Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas since production was low in those areas.  A certified seed grower near Haxtun in extreme northeastern Colorado reported that 70 percent of his seed was sold because his usual customers wanted to claim their seeds early, knowing that the wheat crop in the southeastern part of the state was below par.A certified seed grower in southeastern Colorado near Sheridan Lake harvested only one-fifth of his total acres this summer, but only half of that seed was of decent quality to sell.  The harvested acres yielded roughly one-third of the usual amount.  Altogether, he had about 6 to 7 percent of the wheat he had to sell last year.

The tribes have the oldest water rights and want to maintain adequate flows in the Wood, Williamson, Sprague and Sycan rivers for fish, such as the endangered suckers and redband tout.  The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation uses its water for the Klamath Reclamation Project, an irrigation project supplying water for 225,000 acres straddling the Oregon-California border, and for wildlife refuges that support migrating waterfowl.  The local water master, working for the Oregon Department of Water Resources (ODWR), must begin checking river flows and notifying those with junior water rights to stop pumps and close headgates on diversion dams until the bureau’s and tribes’ water rights are met.  It may take several weeks to make all notifications to increase river flow.  The ODWR has three teams of two people each to visit junior water rights holders and shut off water.  The sheriff will be notified of the teams’ whereabouts at all times for the teams’ safety.  The suspension of junior water rights will continue through the summer as flows in the river fall.  One Klamath County commissioner warned that violence could easily accompany these calls on water rights.

Farmers have pumped groundwater for irrigation in past years, but the water is salty, leading to an accumulation of salt in the soil, which harms crops.  Most of the region’s annual snowfall usually arrives in January, February and early March, so there is still hope for more snow to bolster the water supply.  As of Jan. 30, Elephant Butte Lake held 181,530 acre-feet of water, compared to 330,870 acre-feet last year at this time last year, according to U.S. Bureau of Reclamation records.  Caballo Reservoir contained 8,340 acre-feet on Jan. 30, down from the 14,770 acre-feet that it held one year ago.

During a drought, the impacts to natural resources on this property reflect the effects on the broader ecosystem. As a retired wildlife biologist I notice the frogs and turles in our streams are concentrated around a few bedrock pools, which increases their vulnerability to predators. Herbivores are stressed as nutritious green feed is scarce.

Another cotton grower near Farwell has seen a wide range of yields on his irrigated land, noting that some fields will not be worth harvesting, while others ought to yield three bales per acre.

At least 60 cattle on three different ranches in Logan County, Colorado died.  Roughly 40 sheep died on a ranch near Mertzon, Texas in July.  Anthrax outbreaks are not uncommon west of the Mississippi River and often occur during drought when the anthrax bacteria generate more spores, which become airborne when the soil is disturbed.  Animals frequently come into contact with the spores by ingesting or inhaling them.  Livestock can die from the spores within hours.  Spores can remain viable for decades.  Humans can contract anthrax from infected livestock through a cut in the skin, but the disease is treatable with antibiotics if caught early.  Experts theorize that animals may be stressed by drought and more susceptible to illness.

Vilsack announced three significant improvements to decades-old USDA programs and processes related to Secretarial disaster designations: a final rule that simplifies the process for Secretarial disaster designations and will result in a 40 percent reduction in processing time for most counties affected by disasters; a reduced interest rate for emergency loans that effectively lowers the current rate from 3.75 percent to 2.25 percent; and a payment reduction on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands qualified for emergency haying and grazing in 2012, from 25 to 10 percent. ... The final rule for Secretarial disaster designations is amended as follows: 1) Nearly automatically qualifies a disaster county once it is categorized by the U.S. Drought Monitor as a severe drought for eight consecutive weeks during the growing season. Effective July 12, 1,016 primary counties in 26 states will be designated as natural disaster areas, making all qualified farm operators in the designated areas eligible for low interest emergency loans from USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA), provided eligibility requirements are met. 2) Streamlines the USDA Secretarial designation process, which is expected to provide better service to farmers and ranchers by reducing by approximately 40 percent the amount of time required for designating a disaster area. 3) Removes the requirement that a request for a disaster designation be initiated by a state governor or Indian tribal council, increasing the likelihood that counties will be covered. Indian tribal councils and governors may still submit a request for a designation, but it will not be required in order to initiate a disaster declaration. ...

Pastures declined from lack of rain. Streams and rivers were already low going into summer. Many trees will not recover from last year’s drought. In addition to live oaks and other oak trees dying, cedar trees have seen a die-off. In Sutton County, some cool-season vegetation was beginning to mature and turn brown. Cattle, sheep, and goat prices were high in Uvalde County where producers were trying to restock. Gillespie County reported some restocking, but high prices and lack of rain in the last 30 days slowed the process. Most producers in Kendall County have not restocked because of poor pasture conditions. The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) remains in stage 1 water restrictions. Stage 2 water restrictions will likely be implemented over the weekend or on April 30 as the level of the aquifer has fallen below 650 feet. Many communities across south central Texas have once again started to reinstate water restrictions because of the recent lack of rainfall and increased usage. Austin remains in stage 2 water restrictions and Kerrville and San Marcos are in stage 1 water restrictions. All cities continue to warn residents that stricter restrictions could return at any time if drier conditions develop.

In addition, it was a very dry winter with very little snow compared to other winters.  Our Spring had short grass and about half the quantity of stalks.  The bunch grass was completely dried by mid June, when usually it's not dry until mid July.  The other grasses had gone to seed before June, when usually they go to seed by mid to late June.  There seemed to be not as much pine pollen this year, and I have seen many many more bark beetles everywhere this year than in years past.  In fact, this is the first year in 12 years that I have lived in this area where I saw more than just one or two bark beetles.  This year I have seen hundereds of bark beetles caught inside of boxes and buckets and in cracks and crevaces, in the dry rain gauge, etc.  I'm hoping that I don't lose any pinions to the beetles.  I have noticed that very, very few wildflowers bloomed this year, including the penstemons, lupins, mariposa lilies, maracopa poppies, and california poppies.  In regards to insects: there are much fewer yellow jackets, sweat flies, spiders, june beetles, and moths.  I haven't seen any wasps either, not the tiny ones on the oaks, or the bigger ones.  I haven't seen a scorpion or a jerusalem cricket.  It still sounds like there's lots of crickets at night time.  The dry spell along with the unusually hot May and June probably contributed to the early seeding of the grasses.  I can't say about the birds, because I stopped feeding them this spring.  I can't afford it right now.  I haven't seen any reptiles at all this spring or summer.  Not a lizard or snake.  Every year we see lots of lizards and a few snakes, but not this year.  Not a single reptile.  Hope that comment doesn't conjure up a rattler now....  The burned out forest (Day Fire in '06) is now six years later but after this dry spring and summer, it looks like the fire just happened a year or two ago.  Most of the burned trees are still standing.  No woodpeckers or flickers this year.  The creek bed (Lockwood Creek that crosses over Boy Scout Camp Rd), hasn't had water flowing in it for months.  No thistle plants, when usually I have one or two dozen of them.   This means that there are no humming birds either.  It's a very dry, lean year for plants, animals, and people.  This year it seems that most life forms have it real tough.  A nice thing for me is the competition between McDonalds and Jack-in-the-Box offering $1 large soft drinks.  That makes long drives much more pleasant.  I'm very worried about fires.

In addition, water deliveries are expected to begin in mid-May or early June, according to the general manager of El Paso County Water Improvement District No. 1, but deliveries normally begin in early March.  One cotton grower in the Lower Valley stated that cotton must be watered by April 5 or it won’t grow.

For Victoria County, household trash burning in a barrel will be allowed only if there is a screen on top consisting of holes no larger than 5/8 inch. The area around the barrel should be cleared down to the soil or gravel. All burning must be supervised with ready available means to control the fire.

Although the city of Corpus Christi does not officially begin voluntary water restrictions until the combined system capacity falls to below 50 percent, residents are still encouraged to voluntarily conserve water. Residents in Victoria are also strongly encouraged to conserve. With grasses now dormant, residents should be not be watering their landscapes for growth, but only to maintain deep soil moisture. Thus, watering should be very infrequent, especially after recent rainfall. Also, lawns should be watered before 10 am or after 6 pm to reduce evaporation. Avoid runoff into sidewalks and streets, use a sprinkler that makes larger water droplets, and curtail watering time to less than 30 minutes. Additional locations within the HSA have maintained either mandatory or voluntary restrictions on their local public water systems (PWS): Aransas County: Sunset Bay (voluntary); Bee County: Blueberry Hills Waterworks (voluntary); Calhoun County: the city of Port Comfort (stage 1); Jim Wells County: English Acres (stage 3), Paisano Mobile Home Park (stage 3) and Loma Linda Water Supply (voluntary); Kleberg County: King Ranch Santa Gertrudis District (stage 1) and East Riviera (voluntary); Live Oak: Buckeye Knoll (stage 1), Old Marbach School WSC (voluntary); Nueces County: Nueces County WCID 3 (voluntary); Webb County: Mirando City WSC (voluntary) The drought has also affected the bays and estuaries, as salinity levels in these areas remain high. Because of the higher salinity levels, many oyster beds along the Texas Gulf Coast have been closed, which is affecting many businesses that rely on the industry. These closures were due to the red tide, largely caused by the lack of fresh water normally running into the Gulf. Recent testing shows that concentration is low to moderate. However, reports of dead fish washing up on shore continue. The annual migration of whooping cranes to the Texas coast is being threatened as the drought and red tide lessens the availability of freshwater and food. The lack of adequate feeding of the whooping cranes will make it a difficult and dangerous flight back to Canada as the cranes may become malnourished. Changes in winter migrations for towhees and sparrows have also been noticed. Typically, these birds reside in the western hill country and south Texas. However, due to scarcity of food in these areas, the birds have migrated farther north along the coast. The drought has also taken its toll across Texas, killing many trees (estimated in the millions) since 2010. Thousands of horses and donkeys have also been reported abandoned because of the high (and near record) cost of hay and other feed as well as the lower need for horses to monitor dwindling livestock. The Texas Crop and Weather Reports for January 4 and January 10 contained the following information: For the coastal bend district, supplemental feeding of cattle and importing hay continued. Many ponds remained dry and soil moisture was still below normal levels for spring planting. For western areas (considered part of the south district), stock tanks remained low.

The co-owner of a ranch northwest of Fresno reported that their power use was two and a half times higher than normal.  In response to the higher demand for electricity, utilities were building new transmission lines and substations to support the additional electricity.  In the Central Valley, farmers may use groundwater to meet more than 60 percent of their irrigation needs in 2015, one-third more than a normal year, said a senior researcher at the University of California at Davis Center for Watershed Sciences.  At that rate, electric bills would rise 77 percent, or $600 million, compared to a year with normal precipitation.  The amount of energy needed to pump groundwater was up 90 megawatt-hours, said the senior vice president of regulatory affairs for Southern California Edison Co., a subsidiary of Edison International.

30859,Number of mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus at an all-time high in California,09/15/2014,01/01/2012,12/31/2014,"Nearly 800 Californians were infected with the West Nile virus in 2014, the worst outbreak in a decade.  Drought was blamed for the record number of cases, and 2015 is expected to bring more of the same.  The virus is mainly spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds and transmit the virus to humans.  Many people suffer no ill effects from the virus, while others become extremely sick and even die.When the California drought began in 2012, the number of West Nile virus cases rose to 479 from 158 the previous year.  In 2014, 798 cases were recorded, the highest number since 2005, said the California Department of Public Health.  Twenty-nine people died.  Experts attribute the elevated West Nile activity to stagnant water and water sources in populated areas bringing the virus closer to people.  The virus activity was most intense in Southern California, and especially in Orange County where 266 human cases were reported and the highest rate of infected mosquitoes was found. Water conservation measures prevented the county from flushing its underground storm drains where mosquitoes flourished.  The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 24, 2015The number of California mosquitoes infected with the West Nile virus has risen to record heights this year, according to the California Department of Public Health. Santa Clara County has been a hot spot for birds carrying the West Nile virus, with more than one-third of the total affected birds statewide being found there.  Health departments in Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties have been taking measures to reduce the number mosquitoes with the West Nile virus since mosquitoes transmit the disease to birds. The Santa Clara County Vector Control District found that 1 in 20 mosquitoes were infected with the West Nile virus this summer.  Eighty of Alameda County’s 92 West Nile-positive birds were found in Livermore, leading health officials to pull out the stops to eradicate the mosquitoes.Throughout California, there have been 562 human cases of West Nile reported through Oct. 21, more than twice the count at this time in 2013.  Seventeen deaths have been related to the virus since the start of the year, compared with 15 deaths in all of 2013.  Five human cases leading to the neural-invasive type of complication were confirmed in Contra Costa County.  A dozen people in Santa Clara County contracted the virus, with four being hospitalized also with neural-invasive complications.Public health officials say the uptick in West Nile virus cases could be attributed to climate, the number and types of birds and mosquitoes in an area, birds’ immune systems and drought.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 19, 2014The number of mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus was at an all-time high, said state health officials.  Since the start of the year, 181 cases of West Nile virus were reported to the California Department of Public Health, and eight people have died.  During the last week alone, 52 new cases were reported.  A state public health official said drought may be contributing to the spread of the virus via birds and mosquitoes.

Fifteen to 18 percent of California’s electricity generation typically comes from hydropower, according to Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, but during the drought, hydropower generation dropped to less than 10 percent on average.

Green-tailed towhees, which normally reside in western Hill Country and South Texas during the winter, were staying in the upper coastal regions from Brazoria and Harris counties through Jefferson and Montgomery counties.  The reason for their change of address was the summer drought, which eliminated all food sources in the Hill Country, according to the Hill Country Master Naturalist.  He stated, “I just did my first of three winter transects, and all the sparrow species were low.  There is absolutely no food out there for birds or mammals.""  Spotted towhees, which usually winter in the Hill Country, were there in substantial numbers, but were also appearing in Lake Jackson, Galveston and Houston, which is unusual.

25998,Closure of oyster beds along Texas Gulf Coast affecting many businesses,12/14/2011,12/14/2011, ,"The closure of the coastal oyster beds has hurt the oyster industry, putting fishermen and oyster processers and shippers out of work and cutting into area businesses’ bottom lines.  Drought conditions and the absence of fresh water flowing into the Gulf promoted the growth of red tide, which makes the oysters harmful to those who eat them, and spread a parasite called “dermo” that kills oysters.  In Port Lavaca, the effects of the closure of the oyster beds touched many businesses from gas stations to equipment suppliers to eating establishments where fishermen would be spending money, but without oysters and work, there is no demand for such things.   An oyster transport company in San Leon trucks only four to five loads of Louisiana oysters instead of the ten truckloads of that it used to ship daily.  A seafood company reported that its business was off by 80 percent and noted that other seafood businesses in Port Lavaca were faring similarly.  The owner of a Port Lavaca hardware store revealed that the closure of the oyster beds cost him about $4,000 monthly or about 25 percent of his revenue from November through April.

Nearly all the livestock has been sold. I ranch about 10 sections and don't have anything left to sell. There's some wild sheep and goats left. I estimate that 80% of the cedar trees are dead and have turned a burnt orange color, all the live oak trees have shed their leaves, and there's not a blade of grass on the ground. 5 miles to my west a fire burnt about 300,000 acres in April. You could tell the fire line due to the orange cedar trees in the fire zone and the black ground. Now, you can't tell where it burned because all the cedar looks the same and the ash residue on the ground has blown away. It all looks the same now. I know all the ranchers in 200 miles of me, and there's not enough cows left in this country to have a barbecue. Naturally the weighing price of cows dropped in half due to the volume at the livestock auctions. Instead of getting $.70 cents a pound for a 1,200 lb. cow a few months ago, or around $850.00, the cows are now a little thinner due to the drought and are weighing about 1,000 and bringing $.35 or $350.00 a hd. We're losing around $500.00 a head because there are too many of them for the packing plants to handle. As ranchers, we waited too long to sell, as usual. We've all been hoping and praying for a fall rain, and it never came, so we had to call the trucks and sell out. We couldn't go through a winter with absolutely no grass, $500/00 a ton cow feed, and $150.00 roll of coastal hay weighing 1,000 lbs. So, most of the ranchers are selling out or have already sold out. Those that haven't are looking for winter grass out of state. I don't know what the loss is to the cowman, but we all are in the same boat, with no income next year. The problem coupled with the drought is that we also have a horrible economy with no jobs. So, the rancher can't just go to town and find a job to get by until it starts raining again, which may be a few years from now, according to the National Weather Service. The ranchers from Austin to El Paso are looking at some life-threatening times for their financial future in the coming years. Nobody knows what to do. But, we chose this profession, and don't expect a handout from anybody. Ag. spending will drastically decrease in all these small, rural towns, and every businessowner in Central and West Texas will be affected with fewer sales and less income. This drought will only add gasoline to the fire burning in Washington. The rancher can't draw unemployment, but the laid off workers in these small towns will be able to, and that will increase the unemployment rolls even more. None of us are Washington economists, but we can't see anything positive from this historic drought down here. Those ranchers in the north that got all the rain and held on to their cow herds will be very profitable next year as there should be a lack of calves on the market. We'll just try to survive someway, somehow.","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","Val Verde County, TX",

All grasses are dead, dust devils roam every day over the plowed wheat fields, and all my neighbors have sold the majority of their cattle. My ponds have lost eleven to twelve feet of depth. Perhaps now would be a good time to hire a dozer, to dig out and enlarge my ponds to hold more water and raise the Conservation Depth Level that keeps the pond water from reaching 90+ degrees when oxygen depletion begins and aquatic life starts to fail. Whenever it rains again - my property drains rainfall from over 2000 acres - so if it rains 3.5 inches in one go - the ground saturates, and the water overflows two lakes north of me, and about a dozen other ponds that each overflows into another - until all that water meets from three directions and empties into my property into both of my ponds, and on into the Keechi Creek - that is a tributary of the Brazos River –meeting it 17 miles downstream - just below the Possum Kingdom Lake Dam.

Some sold out completely, others reduced herds drastically. (We sold 50% of our animals, others we know sold 80% or more.) This was done to reduce costs of feeding stock throughout the summer and winter, as the price of hay and feeds soared. Also impacting everyone was the sharply reduced amount of water available.  Our stock pond shrunk to almost dry, about 5% of its previous level, and many in the county lost all water, and sold out completely.  Streams dried up, and fish and turtles died in great numbers as the waters retreated to a few scummy pools.2012      Rainfall increased, but was several inches below normal.  Hay, corn, and livestock feed remained in short supply (ethanol induced?) and at greatly increased price.  Our hay crop was up to about 40% of previous years, but feed prices made everyone hesitant about increasing herd size.  Stock ponds came up, but only another 5-10 percent. Streams were flowing, but much lower than previous years.2013Rainfall at this location remains sparse (only 8.25 inches through April), and although pastures have greened up, they are not lush, only alive and growing slowly.

Irrigation continues to be possible along the Rio Grande but at a high cost to agriculture as allotments have been used and water now when available must be purchased at high rate. Only significant rains since 09/2010 were 2 days mid August of less than an inch and that varied across the county. When speaking to ""old hands"" in their 80's none can remember such a drought. We have had hotter summers but our ""normal"" heat with weeks in the hundreds with no rain has impacted immensely. Many folks in agriculture are quitting. Mesquite trees are dying that have lived over a century. Prickly pear that in years past could be used as range feed is withering. Brown outs have become common to conserve energy. High energy bills are impacting the poor particularly the elderly who for health and age must use more electrical energy to make life bearable. Cattle in the fields require water to be hauled as natural water sources have disappeared. I cannot overstate the effects of this drought on everyone and everything in this county. Virtually all rural areas in the county rely on wells or local water sources often requiring water to be boiled to make it safe.","Agriculture, Energy, Fire, Plants & Wildlife, Society & Public Health, Water Supply & Quality","Maverick County, TX",

I grew up during the 40's-50's drought in South Texas, and in some ways this has been more severe on the wildlife. I have been feeding birds and deer on my 5-ac for 13 years. The deer population has increased from 4-6 to 9-12. In the last few months I have had to go to multiple evening feedings of a high protein deer food and corn 5:1. Different than the 1:1 just a year ago. Besides no grasses there have been no weeds, flowers, or fruit on the Mexican persimmon (a favorite of the deer, 'coons, etc.) My feed store bill has gone from the normal $30/month to $80/month and increasing still. My well production has declined; I have hooked up a 300-gal tank and on-demand pump for the house. For outside, I am getting water in 65-gal barrels from friends with good wells, and sump-pumping into my rainwater tanks so I can use that system. I put out about 20 gallons of water out for wildlife daily. (A small tank for the deer, bird bath, and 16-in. saucers on the ground for rabbits, birds, and occasionally a snake or some other critter...lately a skunk (that broke into my screened porch.)

I will have a new well dug this month or next...if I hit water, I will complete the well when either my current well goes dry, or I get the money saved for completion. In Rio Llano (as in the county) wells have gone dry, or are low producing, and animals particularly skunks seem to be plentiful around areas where water is being put out for livestock, etc. The City is at stage 4 so all the yards and most outside vegetation is drying. The Llano River has stopped flowing on occasion...which didn't even happen a few years ago during a prolonged dry spell. Since I am retired other than feed for wildlife and water concerns, I personally have not been impacted to a great extent.

Ground cover vegetation, both lawn grass and unmaintained areas with weeds and grasses, has turned brown and is brittle under foot. Walking across my brown lawn reminds me of walking across ground that is covered with snow that has refrozen and crunches when stepped on. The impatiens my wife planted finally died off last week despite watering them sufficiently to keep them alive without over watering them to the point of burning their leaves. This is the first time that has ever happened. Wildlife has few sources of water. I have observed Starlings and Grackles waiting in trees around parking lots for cars to pull out of a parking space so that the birds can get a drink from the little puddle of water created from the car's air conditioning. I refill the bird bath in my yard twice per day. I have seen rabbits standing on their hind legs to get a drink from the bird bath. I had never seen a rabbit drink water in my 50 years until last week. I go through 100 pounds of bird seed for my bird feeder each month. I have a high concentration of heavy black clay in my soil. Despite watering as much as possible within the confines of the mandatory water restrictions we are under, I have not been able to prevent large cracks from opening in my back yard. Some cracks are 2"" wide with no measurable bottom to the crack. An 8' rod can be inserted in the cracks to the full 8' depth without hitting bottom. My concrete driveway has sections that have risen (or lowered) by as much as 2"". Using a rubber mallet produces a hollow sound in some sections of the driveway. Cracks have developed in most of the concrete slabs on my driveway. One slab has a crack to full depth and a corner of the slab representing about 20% of the slab has broken. When my wife pulls into the driveway I can watch the slabs move up and down. My back door leading to my deck behind the house has gotten to where I won't open it anymore because it sticks so bad. I fear I may have a cracked foundation (slab). Electricity costs for air conditioning needed due to the record breaking high temperatures have increased by about 10% from past years.

The drought is worsening, as agriculturally significant rainfalls (i.e. over one inch in 24 hours) occurred mainly in the early second and fourth months. The only exception to this pattern was a 1.65-inch rain recorded in the ninth month. This current drought follows a one-year period of normal rainfall. Before that, this station suffered greatly from the effects of a two-year drought that began Sept. 5, 2007 and lasted until Sept. 7, 2009. From September 2007 through August 2008 rainfall totaled 19.19 inches at this station, and from September 2008 through August 2009 rainfall totaled 15.94 inches, for a two-year total of 35.13 inches, or just over 50 percent of normal. The toll on Plants and Wildlife for that two-year drought could be estimated at more than $10,000 to $20,000 because of the loss of several hundred mature trees on a 40-acre property in the Post Oak Savannah ecosystem of Texas. The losses included several hickory trees estimated to be 100 years old or older, plus numerous post oaks, blackjack oaks and Shumard oaks. In the current 10-month drought, two out of three stock ponds went dry in the eighth month. The main impact, to date, is the doubling of the cost of forage (hay) to sustain a small herd of cattle and three horses; stress on the cattle herd, contributing to the death of one cow; and necessary culling of the herd, forcing the sale of otherwise healthy and productive mama cows.","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","Guadalupe County, TX",

The return to more rainfall and less drought has helped trees resist the bark beetles that have damaged and killed so many trees.  Since drought began in 2010, more than 147 million trees on 9.7 million acres died.  The slowing rate of tree mortality was encouraging.  Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Feb. 11, 2019Trees continued to die in the Sierra Nevada more than a year after the end of California’s multiyear drought.  The U.S. Forest Service reported that 27 million trees died since November 2016, bringing the total of dead trees to roughly 129 million on about 8.9 million acres of land since 2010.  The trees were stressed and dehydrated by drought, making them more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations and other ills.The density of dead trees was so great in areas that foresters closed roads and campgrounds to protect the public from falling trees.

Sixty-two million trees died in 2016 alone.  The die-off presents an enormous fire threat, not to mention the challenge of removing the trees, particularly those near power lines, roads and near people.  Most of the dead trees were in the central and southern Sierra.  Los Angeles Times (Calif.), Nov. 28, 2016Roughly 66 million trees died since 2010 in a six-county region of California’s central and southern Sierra Nevada most severely affected by the drought, a bark beetle epidemic and warm temperatures, according to the U.S. Forest Service.  The tree mortality from Tuolumne to Kern counties rose by 65 percent since the last figures announced in October 2015, which documented 40 million dead trees.  The sheer number of dead trees could fuel catastrophic wildfires and endanger people’s lives, said officials.  California’s Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency and formed a task committee to quickly remove the trees for public safety, but the tree removal process has not gone quickly enough.  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service, said in a statement, ""Tree die-offs of this magnitude are unprecedented and increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires that puts property and lives at risk.  We must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country.""San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), June 22, 2016California’s ongoing drought and a bark beetle epidemic contributed to the largest tree die-off in the Sierra Nevada’s modern history, leaving around 40 million dead trees that could fall on people or fuel ferocious wildfires that could threaten mountain communities.  Most of the dead trees were in the central and southern Sierra, and the epidemic was moving north.Crews were felling trees, but have no way to dispose of them all.  One option is to use 10 large mechanized incinerators to burn up some of the trees, but environmentalists say that is not a good solution.

We started gathering all of our animals for sale.  We sold all of our non-replacement heifers early in preparation.  Fortunately we have had some recent rains that have helped; however, the grass is still very short and we plan to start selling off cow/calf pairs.  The oak trees and pine trees have seen mass die-off over the past few years.  This is in San Luis Obispo County.From San Luis Obispo County, California, on March 20, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","San Luis Obispo County, CA, Shandon, CA",
29789,Land in the San Joaquin Valley of California has been sinking as farmers pump excessive amounts of groundwater,07/13/2018,01/01/2008,07/13/2018,"Some of the highest rates of land subsidence in the world were found in the San Joaquin Valley, where water is over pumped to irrigate crops amid ongoing drought, stated a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.  Parts of the Central Valley were sinking more than one foot each year, and some areas were ten feet lower than they used to be.  The subsidence has buckled the walls of irrigation canals, damaged pipes, created giant sink holes and cracked homes.   CBS News, Aug. 18, 2015Amid persistent drought and low water allocations, Central Valley farmers continued to over pump groundwater to irrigate crops at a high cost to groundwater stores, which were critically endangered prior to the drought.  Some areas have seen drops of 50 feet or more in their water tables in a few years with alarming and permanent land subsidence causing structural damage to canals, roads and bridges.    A Los Banos farmer noted that over pumping and land subsidence meant that water, to which he has high priority rights, would need to flow uphill to reach his fields.  He intends to fallow 2,300 acres of his 10,500 acres.  New York Times, April 5, 2015Land in the San Joaquin Valley continues to sink as farmers pump excessive amounts of groundwater.  The subsidence was especially pronounced from 2008 to 2010 during drought as farmers pumped more groundwater than usual to make up for decreased water allocations.

The board first adopted the resolution declaring a local emergency on June 19, and they have re-authorized the declaration every two weeks since June 19.  The drought emergency remains in effect as of March 2, 2011 because one of the Kings County supervisors mistakenly pushed the wrong button during the vote to extend the measure.  He stated that he will vote differently on March 29 when the issue will be revisited.

40566,Many female tortoises died in California's Joshua Tree National Park,05/18/2017,05/17/2007,05/17/2017,"Numerous female desert tortoises have died in Southern California, and it seems that the creatures died trying to reproduce amid the recent drought.  The tortoises likely used up their water and energy to lay eggs.  Fewer males have died than females in the Joshua Tree National Park.  From the state of deterioration of the carcasses and chalkiness of the bones, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the tortoises died within the last 5 to 10 years, which encompasses the past five years of intense drought.

In a 2018 report, the National Park Service stated that climate change, drought, invasive plants and certain activities, such as woodcutting and cattle grazing, have reduced the number of seedlings to replace older cactuses.

29853,Drought was linked to a decrease in the desert tortoise population in a one square-mile study plot in Joshua Tree National Park in southern California,12/16/2013,01/01/1996,12/31/2012,"Drought was linked to a decrease in the desert tortoise population in a one square-mile study plot in Joshua Tree National Park, according to a study by the U.S. Geological Survey.  The tortoises were monitored from 1996 through 2012, during which there were periods of drought, and their numbers fell from 175 to 200 tortoises at the beginning of the study to about 25 tortoises at the end.  Two to three years of drought were observed to seriously compromise the tortoises’ survival.  Drought kills the annual plants, leading to a die-off of the rodents that eat the plants.  Then coyotes, which normally eat kangaroo rats and rabbits, begin eating tortoises, said the lead researcher of the USGS team.
