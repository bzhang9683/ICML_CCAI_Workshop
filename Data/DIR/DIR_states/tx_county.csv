The shortage of forage and hay will be problematic, meaning that producers might save money by whittling the herd down.  Producers must be careful not to overgraze pastures.  Cool temperatures were also part of the problem.  Winter lasted longer than usual, with a cool spring making the hay crop smaller than normal.

Ranchers continue to cull herds since the native and improved grasses are still not growing at a rate that will sustain livestock.  Because the winter wheat crop progressed faster than normal rates due to the early rise in temperatures, the crop headed out before maturity; the subsequent occurrence of some below-freezing nights and hail led to a failure of almost 80% of the crop.

The executive director of the Colorado Wheat Research Foundation, which works with the growers of certified seed varieties created by Colorado State University, said that supplies would be tight, but there should be sufficient supplies if farmers contact their dealers early.  Growers of certified seed in northeastern Colorado have received requests for seed from southeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and the panhandles of Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas since production was low in those areas.  A certified seed grower near Haxtun in extreme northeastern Colorado reported that 70 percent of his seed was sold because his usual customers wanted to claim their seeds early, knowing that the wheat crop in the southeastern part of the state was below par.A certified seed grower in southeastern Colorado near Sheridan Lake harvested only one-fifth of his total acres this summer, but only half of that seed was of decent quality to sell.  The harvested acres yielded roughly one-third of the usual amount.  Altogether, he had about 6 to 7 percent of the wheat he had to sell last year.  He was trying to buy seed from northern Colorado, but will have to raise the price 20 to 30 percent to cover transportation costs.

The lakes held roughly 825,000 acre-feet in early January and were not likely to fill much more before the March 1 deadline.  The LCRA voted in November to withhold irrigation water if the combined lake storage was less than 775,000 acre-feet, but opted to reconsider that threshold since November and December brought little precipitation.

27724,Drought devastated dryland cotton in the Texas Panhandle,11/01/2012,10/31/2012, ,"Drought devastated dryland cotton in Parmer and Bailey counties, according to a Texas Agri-Life specialist.  Overall, cotton production in those counties looks to be down 10 to 20 percent, but the actual shortfall will become apparent when the harvest is further along.  A cotton grower with a field east of Farwell anticipated a decrease in yield on his irrigated land from three bales per acre to just two bales this year.  His rainfed cotton will not even make one bale per acre.  In other years, he has gotten 5,000 to 6,000 bales from his 2,000 acres of land with some rainfed and some irrigated fields, but anticipated getting roughly 1,000 bales altogether this year.  Another cotton grower near Farwell has seen a wide range of yields on his irrigated land, noting that some fields will not be worth harvesting, while others ought to yield three bales per acre.  This farmer said, “The second year of the drought is that much more devastating due to less ground moisture. We've pumped our wells for two years now and don't have the well capacity in most places to pump the amount of water we need for the crops.""  The general manager of Parmer County Cotton Growers reported that farmers brought in 40 percent less cotton for ginning this year, but said that hail took out about 20 percent of the acreage and that water was used on more lucrative crops, rather than cotton.

At least 60 cattle on three different ranches in Logan County, Colorado died.  Roughly 40 sheep died on a ranch near Mertzon, Texas in July.  Anthrax outbreaks are not uncommon west of the Mississippi River and often occur during drought when the anthrax bacteria generate more spores, which become airborne when the soil is disturbed.  Animals frequently come into contact with the spores by ingesting or inhaling them.  Livestock can die from the spores within hours.  Spores can remain viable for decades.  Humans can contract anthrax from infected livestock through a cut in the skin, but the disease is treatable with antibiotics if caught early.

Meager snowfall in New Mexico and Colorado was responsible for the drastically reduced allotment.  In addition, water deliveries are expected to begin in mid-May or early June, according to the general manager of El Paso County Water Improvement District No. 1, but deliveries normally begin in early March.  One cotton grower in the Lower Valley stated that cotton must be watered by April 5 or it won’t grow.

Another cotton grower in the Lower Valley and Hudspeth County intends to plant 148 of his 950 acres with cotton.  Both growers expect to have to lay off employees unless they get more water soon and can plant more acres.

San Patricio County has reinstated its ban and the remainder of south Texas continues with burn bans. For Victoria County, household trash burning in a barrel will be allowed only if there is a screen on top consisting of holes no larger than 5/8 inch. The area around the barrel should be cleared down to the soil or gravel. All burning must be supervised with ready available means to control the fire. In addition, the Victoria County fire marshal’s office shall be notified of any acreage or pile burning. The city of Laredo officially remains under voluntary water restrictions. Although the city of Corpus Christi does not officially begin voluntary water restrictions until the combined system capacity falls to below 50 percent, residents are still encouraged to voluntarily conserve water. Residents in Victoria are also strongly encouraged to conserve. With grasses now dormant, residents should be not be watering their landscapes for growth, but only to maintain deep soil moisture. Thus, watering should be very infrequent, especially after recent rainfall. Also, lawns should be watered before 10 am or after 6 pm to reduce evaporation. Avoid runoff into sidewalks and streets, use a sprinkler that makes larger water droplets, and curtail watering time to less than 30 minutes. Additional locations within the HSA have maintained either mandatory or voluntary restrictions on their local public water systems (PWS): Aransas County: Sunset Bay (voluntary); Bee County: Blueberry Hills Waterworks (voluntary); Calhoun County: the city of Port Comfort (stage 1); Jim Wells County: English Acres (stage 3), Paisano Mobile Home Park (stage 3) and Loma Linda Water Supply (voluntary); Kleberg County: King Ranch Santa Gertrudis District (stage 1) and East Riviera (voluntary); Live Oak: Buckeye Knoll (stage 1), Old Marbach School WSC (voluntary); Nueces County: Nueces County WCID 3 (voluntary); Webb County: Mirando City WSC (voluntary) The drought has also affected the bays and estuaries, as salinity levels in these areas remain high. Because of the higher salinity levels, many oyster beds along the Texas Gulf Coast have been closed, which is affecting many businesses that rely on the industry. These closures were due to the red tide, largely caused by the lack of fresh water normally running into the Gulf. Recent testing shows that concentration is low to moderate. However, reports of dead fish washing up on shore continue. The annual migration of whooping cranes to the Texas coast is being threatened as the drought and red tide lessens the availability of freshwater and food. The lack of adequate feeding of the whooping cranes will make it a difficult and dangerous flight back to Canada as the cranes may become malnourished. Changes in winter migrations for towhees and sparrows have also been noticed. Typically, these birds reside in the western hill country and south Texas. However, due to scarcity of food in these areas, the birds have migrated farther north along the coast. The drought has also taken its toll across Texas, killing many trees (estimated in the millions) since 2010. Thousands of horses and donkeys have also been reported abandoned because of the high (and near record) cost of hay and other feed as well as the lower need for horses to monitor dwindling livestock. The Texas Crop and Weather Reports for January 4 and January 10 contained the following information: For the coastal bend district, supplemental feeding of cattle and importing hay continued. Many ponds remained dry and soil moisture was still below normal levels for spring planting. For western areas (considered part of the south district), stock tanks remained low. Supplemental feeding continued low forage supplies were low and rangelands and pastures were in poor condition. Overall, soil moisture levels were short to very short, with the exception of McMullen County being 50 to 60 percent adequate. Hay was in short supply and prices continue to increase.

Because the birds usually walk around a one square mile area in search of water, it consumes valuable energy to fly to reach water sources that would normally be plentiful and within walking distance for the birds.  Reduced protein supplies from the dearth of blue crabs can diminish the likelihood of successful return to summer nesting grounds.  The manager of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge where the birds winter noted that one bird died, and expressed concern that there was a death so early in the winter.

Green-tailed towhees, which normally reside in western Hill Country and South Texas during the winter, were staying in the upper coastal regions from Brazoria and Harris counties through Jefferson and Montgomery counties.

Drought conditions and the absence of fresh water flowing into the Gulf promoted the growth of red tide, which makes the oysters harmful to those who eat them, and spread a parasite called “dermo” that kills oysters.  In Port Lavaca, the effects of the closure of the oyster beds touched many businesses from gas stations to equipment suppliers to eating establishments where fishermen would be spending money, but without oysters and work, there is no demand for such things.   An oyster transport company in San Leon trucks only four to five loads of Louisiana oysters instead of the ten truckloads of that it used to ship daily.

If there is less than 850,000 acre-feet of water, rice farmers will receive no water for their crop.  If the volume held in lakes Travis and Buchanan was between 850,000 and 920,000 acre-feet, the LCRA will release as much as 125,000 acre-feet of water to rice farmers, which is substantially less than they normally receive.  If the lakes contain more than 920,000 acre-feet, the LCRA will distribute water as laid out in their water management plan.

Nearly all the livestock has been sold. I ranch about 10 sections and don't have anything left to sell. There's some wild sheep and goats left. I estimate that 80% of the cedar trees are dead and have turned a burnt orange color, all the live oak trees have shed their leaves, and there's not a blade of grass on the ground. 5 miles to my west a fire burnt about 300,000 acres in April. You could tell the fire line due to the orange cedar trees in the fire zone and the black ground. Now, you can't tell where it burned because all the cedar looks the same and the ash residue on the ground has blown away. It all looks the same now. I know all the ranchers in 200 miles of me, and there's not enough cows left in this country to have a barbecue. Naturally the weighing price of cows dropped in half due to the volume at the livestock auctions. Instead of getting $.70 cents a pound for a 1,200 lb. cow a few months ago, or around $850.00, the cows are now a little thinner due to the drought and are weighing about 1,000 and bringing $.35 or $350.00 a hd. We're losing around $500.00 a head because there are too many of them for the packing plants to handle. As ranchers, we waited too long to sell, as usual. We've all been hoping and praying for a fall rain, and it never came, so we had to call the trucks and sell out. We couldn't go through a winter with absolutely no grass, $500/00 a ton cow feed, and $150.00 roll of coastal hay weighing 1,000 lbs. So, most of the ranchers are selling out or have already sold out. Those that haven't are looking for winter grass out of state. I don't know what the loss is to the cowman, but we all are in the same boat, with no income next year. The problem coupled with the drought is that we also have a horrible economy with no jobs. So, the rancher can't just go to town and find a job to get by until it starts raining again, which may be a few years from now, according to the National Weather Service. The ranchers from Austin to El Paso are looking at some life-threatening times for their financial future in the coming years. Nobody knows what to do. But, we chose this profession, and don't expect a handout from anybody. Ag. spending will drastically decrease in all these small, rural towns, and every businessowner in Central and West Texas will be affected with fewer sales and less income. This drought will only add gasoline to the fire burning in Washington. The rancher can't draw unemployment, but the laid off workers in these small towns will be able to, and that will increase the unemployment rolls even more. None of us are Washington economists, but we can't see anything positive from this historic drought down here. Those ranchers in the north that got all the rain and held on to their cow herds will be very profitable next year as there should be a lack of calves on the market. We'll just try to survive someway, somehow.","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","Val Verde County, TX",

Some sold out completely, others reduced herds drastically. (We sold 50% of our animals, others we know sold 80% or more.) This was done to reduce costs of feeding stock throughout the summer and winter, as the price of hay and feeds soared. Also impacting everyone was the sharply reduced amount of water available.  Our stock pond shrunk to almost dry, about 5% of its previous level, and many in the county lost all water, and sold out completely.  Streams dried up, and fish and turtles died in great numbers as the waters retreated to a few scummy pools.2012      Rainfall increased, but was several inches below normal.  Hay, corn, and livestock feed remained in short supply (ethanol induced?) and at greatly increased price.  Our hay crop was up to about 40% of previous years, but feed prices made everyone hesitant about increasing herd size.  Stock ponds came up, but only another 5-10 percent. Streams were flowing, but much lower than previous years.2013Rainfall at this location remains sparse (only 8.25 inches through April), and although pastures have greened up, they are not lush, only alive and growing slowly. Increasing livestock numbers seems chancy. Ponds are almost static; creeks are running, but slowly. Fish numbers appear somewhat increased, and nesting activity is still not up to previous years.

I grew up during the 40's-50's drought in South Texas, and in some ways this has been more severe on the wildlife. I have been feeding birds and deer on my 5-ac for 13 years. The deer population has increased from 4-6 to 9-12. In the last few months I have had to go to multiple evening feedings of a high protein deer food and corn 5:1. Different than the 1:1 just a year ago. Besides no grasses there have been no weeds, flowers, or fruit on the Mexican persimmon (a favorite of the deer, 'coons, etc.) My feed store bill has gone from the normal $30/month to $80/month and increasing still. My well production has declined; I have hooked up a 300-gal tank and on-demand pump for the house. For outside, I am getting water in 65-gal barrels from friends with good wells, and sump-pumping into my rainwater tanks so I can use that system. I put out about 20 gallons of water out for wildlife daily. (A small tank for the deer, bird bath, and 16-in. saucers on the ground for rabbits, birds, and occasionally a snake or some other critter...lately a skunk (that broke into my screened porch.) I raised only 4 tomato plants in the garden, and have lost my asparagus 'patch' of 10 years. I will have a new well dug this month or next...if I hit water, I will complete the well when either my current well goes dry, or I get the money saved for completion. In Rio Llano (as in the county) wells have gone dry, or are low producing, and animals particularly skunks seem to be plentiful around areas where water is being put out for livestock, etc. The City is at stage 4 so all the yards and most outside vegetation is drying. The Llano River has stopped flowing on occasion...which didn't even happen a few years ago during a prolonged dry spell. Since I am retired other than feed for wildlife and water concerns, I personally have not been impacted to a great extent. Rancher friends report that their weaned calves are at about 300lbs vs 500+lbs during normal years. Cattle and goats are being sold off with increasing frequency. All my feeding has allowed one of my does to raise twin fawns....most reports are that the does are raising only the strongest or just walking away.","Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Llano County, TX",

Ground cover vegetation, both lawn grass and unmaintained areas with weeds and grasses, has turned brown and is brittle under foot. Walking across my brown lawn reminds me of walking across ground that is covered with snow that has refrozen and crunches when stepped on. The impatiens my wife planted finally died off last week despite watering them sufficiently to keep them alive without over watering them to the point of burning their leaves. This is the first time that has ever happened. Wildlife has few sources of water. I have observed Starlings and Grackles waiting in trees around parking lots for cars to pull out of a parking space so that the birds can get a drink from the little puddle of water created from the car's air conditioning. I refill the bird bath in my yard twice per day. I have seen rabbits standing on their hind legs to get a drink from the bird bath. I had never seen a rabbit drink water in my 50 years until last week. I go through 100 pounds of bird seed for my bird feeder each month. I have a high concentration of heavy black clay in my soil. Despite watering as much as possible within the confines of the mandatory water restrictions we are under, I have not been able to prevent large cracks from opening in my back yard. Some cracks are 2"" wide with no measurable bottom to the crack. An 8' rod can be inserted in the cracks to the full 8' depth without hitting bottom. My concrete driveway has sections that have risen (or lowered) by as much as 2"". Using a rubber mallet produces a hollow sound in some sections of the driveway. Cracks have developed in most of the concrete slabs on my driveway. One slab has a crack to full depth and a corner of the slab representing about 20% of the slab has broken. When my wife pulls into the driveway I can watch the slabs move up and down. My back door leading to my deck behind the house has gotten to where I won't open it anymore because it sticks so bad. I fear I may have a cracked foundation (slab). Electricity costs for air conditioning needed due to the record breaking high temperatures have increased by about 10% from past years.

The drought is worsening, as agriculturally significant rainfalls (i.e. over one inch in 24 hours) occurred mainly in the early second and fourth months. The only exception to this pattern was a 1.65-inch rain recorded in the ninth month. This current drought follows a one-year period of normal rainfall. Before that, this station suffered greatly from the effects of a two-year drought that began Sept. 5, 2007 and lasted until Sept. 7, 2009. From September 2007 through August 2008 rainfall totaled 19.19 inches at this station, and from September 2008 through August 2009 rainfall totaled 15.94 inches, for a two-year total of 35.13 inches, or just over 50 percent of normal. The toll on Plants and Wildlife for that two-year drought could be estimated at more than $10,000 to $20,000 because of the loss of several hundred mature trees on a 40-acre property in the Post Oak Savannah ecosystem of Texas. The losses included several hickory trees estimated to be 100 years old or older, plus numerous post oaks, blackjack oaks and Shumard oaks. In the current 10-month drought, two out of three stock ponds went dry in the eighth month. The main impact, to date, is the doubling of the cost of forage (hay) to sustain a small herd of cattle and three horses; stress on the cattle herd, contributing to the death of one cow; and necessary culling of the herd, forcing the sale of otherwise healthy and productive mama cows.","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife","Guadalupe County, TX",

Livestock producers are still having to reduce herd size due to lack of grass and feed sources. Tanks levels are still low and water remains a valuable commodity that is often being trucked in for livestock usage. High winds have already begun to reduce soil moisture levels and the rain was insufficient for row crop farmers to plant a viable crop.

30407,"Brewster County, Texas, stressed vegetation, forced to cut cow herd due to lack of feed, burn ban",05/13/2014,10/01/2009,05/07/2014,"Very little precipitation during 2013 water year.  So far in the 2014 water year beginning 10/01/2014 there has been slight precipitation and more wind than ordinary.  We had extreme icing conditions for a five day period with 20 power poles snapped and complete power outage during the five day period.  Also several extended hard freezes (2-4 day duration), and a very late hard freeze (20 F) in late April.  The late freeze killed the leaves of most mesquite bushes, many shrubs and trees.  Mesquite is coming back from the base and most damaged trees and shrubs are leafing out again.  A few trees and shrubs might have been killed.  The combination of extreme windy, dry conditions with cold temperatures have stressed all vegetation.  There is very little if any grass growing.  Livestock are being fed hay, cake and grazing on whatever they can find.  We are being vigilant removing poisonous plants from pastures to prevent livestock deaths.  We have been forced to shut down our swine operation due to the increased operating costs from the drought.  We have cut the cow herd by 75% because of lack of feed.  The wild deer look horrible, we are letting them eat with the other livestock to help them out.  The numbers of mature Rio Grande Turkeys on the ranch are diminishing.  We have not observed a clutch of young in the last two years.  We have not seen quail for six years.  We have quit watering our landscape with the exception of a few select trees and shrubs.  Our well began sucking air during Summer 2012 while we were attempting to irrigate some areas of good native grass for the livestock.  We have not irrigated since and have not had any further problems with the well.  Brewster county has had a burn ban in place for over four years.  It has been briefly lifted during that time when we have snow or a lengthy wet period.  But most people do not burn even then and we all have large piles of brush that we will someday burn or just let decompose.

26732,"Producer sells some breeding stock, continues to buy supplemental feed in Brewster County, Texas",05/16/2012,09/01/2008,04/30/2012,"We have had to sell some of our breeding cattle and pigs, keeping only the best because of the huge increase in feed prices and lack of grass.  We continue to buy hay and supplemental feed for the remaining cattle and horses at a much higher cost for lesser quality feed.   We have lost most of the grass in the pastures and almost half of the trees have died.  We have spent a lot of time and money pulling out dead trees and trying to prevent severe erosion and gullies forming when we do get rain.  With the drought, the ground water is not being replenished and our well is not supplying water as it historically has.  We have sucked air a few times while attempting to water the remaining windbreak trees around the farm and keep some of the pasture grass from dying.  We keep three thousand gallons of water in stock tanks available for fire fighting and for deer, turkeys and other wildlife to drink.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Alpine 7.9 SE on 4/30/2012","Agriculture, Water Supply & Quality","Brewster County, TX",
