29379,"Exceptional drought conditions and late freezes cut into the amount of certified wheat produced in southeastern Colorado, leading to reduced supplies of seed for the next planting",08/10/2013,08/06/2013, ,"Exceptional drought conditions and late freezes cut into the amount of certified wheat produced in southeastern Colorado, leading to reduced supplies of seed for the next planting.  The executive director of the Colorado Wheat Research Foundation, which works with the growers of certified seed varieties created by Colorado State University, said that supplies would be tight, but there should be sufficient supplies if farmers contact their dealers early.  Growers of certified seed in northeastern Colorado have received requests for seed from southeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and the panhandles of Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas since production was low in those areas.  A certified seed grower near Haxtun in extreme northeastern Colorado reported that 70 percent of his seed was sold because his usual customers wanted to claim their seeds early, knowing that the wheat crop in the southeastern part of the state was below par.A certified seed grower in southeastern Colorado near Sheridan Lake harvested only one-fifth of his total acres this summer, but only half of that seed was of decent quality to sell.  The harvested acres yielded roughly one-third of the usual amount.  Altogether, he had about 6 to 7 percent of the wheat he had to sell last year.  He was trying to buy seed from northern Colorado, but will have to raise the price 20 to 30 percent to cover transportation costs.

The signs of drought in 2013 are very subtle in many cases.  The tulips this year were not more than one foot tall compared with 18 inches last year.  The blanket flowers are thin stalks above a cluster of leaves rather than bushy plants like last year.  The Asiatic lilies in bloom are a little over one foot tall not over two feet tall like last year.  The purple cone flowers are about 18 inches tall rather than over 3 feet like last year.  The strange winter and spring had an effect, but the drought impact has become obvious.  Trees budded and bloomed later than usual.  The number of blossoms were reduced.  But after the leaves came out I could see the damage to my young maple tree as well as to other trees in the neighborhood.  The top half of the tree had winter killed, but that wasn't obvious until the leaves came out.  Other trees had winter damage especially near the tops. As I drive around it is easy to see which trees are most susceptible such as aspen, cottonwoods, ash, elms, and maples.  Blue spruce have either made it or not, I have not seen partial damage.  The trees that have consistently survived are the lindens once they are established.  Newly planted lindens are touch and go as can be seen near the Aurora government center on Alameda.  Some oaks look good, like the gamble oak and burr oak in my yard while I have seen others with a lot of dead branch tips.  What seem to be unaffected by the drought so far are my Fremont geraniums, my claret cup cacti, and my penstemons.  I have had more birds at my feeders than usual for this time of year.

Even watering was only keeping them alive and their foliage was sparse. The garden was a disaster, no amount of watering made up for the drought conditions. Now the wheat we planted to feed calves through the winter hardly came up and what did is very stressed, therefore we will not be able to raise calves this year for butchering. Our ponds are dry and there is no water for the wildlife. Conditions are very critical for us. Even though our livelihood is not derived from the land on which we live, a large portion of it is still related to farming, as we own a farm at a different location in the county.
