One invertebrate biologist with the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department in Austin reported seeing just four or so monarchs in the past three weeks.  It was thought that the reduction in flowers that provide nectar for the butterflies and many acres burned by wildfires resulted in a wide migration route, which could explain why monarchs were seen from the Davis Mountains in West Texas to the I-35 corridor, although they would normally fly a narrower route.  An entomologist who coordinates the Texas Monarch Watch, stemming from the monarch education and research organization in Kansas, was concerned about the number of dead plants, few butterflies and dying juniper in the Hill Country and noted that there was precious little to nourish the butterflies on their journey.

No new fawns were found among 76 white-tailed deer in a 30-mile area in the Panhandle.  In the same area, only 3 quail were seen, where biologists would normally find 15.  Deer were dying from inadequate water supplies in South Texas, where 20 dead adult deer were found on one ranch.  Quail were not able to reproduce this year, according to the game bird program leader for Texas Parks and Wildlife.  In the northeastern Panhandle and north central Texas, the quail population was at historic lows, with a count of just 5 in areas where 21 were usually found.  Only one quail was found in a 20-mile radius in the Hill Country where 5 or more were normally found.  Six scaled quail were seen in the Trans Pecos region of West Texas where usually 16 or more birds would be found.  The antelope population in the Trans Pecos area has been suffering from a parasite for several years that has reduced the number of antelope.  Drought will likely further reduce antelope numbers.  A survey of antelopes in the northeastern Panhandle in June and July revealed 16 fawns among the 100 does, whereas there would usually be 35 fawns, indicating a fairly high mortality rate.  Antelope, deer and mule deer bucks may not fare well this breeding season because they use lots of energy and require adequate food to recover well afterward. Does were already doing poorly, which explains the meager fawn crops, which was as low as 27 percent in parts of the Southeast and Central Texas.

More infant bats than usual were dying, suggesting that adult bats were not able to find enough food to supply themselves and their young.  The 20 million bats from the Bracken cave were coming out up to two hours before nightfall to travel greater distances to reach insects that inhabit corn and cotton plants.

The manager of the Old Tunnel Wildlife Management Area noted that the number of bats usually doubles in August as the young bats begin to fly, but the drastic change in the evening departures from the tunnel indicates that there are many fewer bats, meaning that many young probably did not survive.

Comments: The estimated Texas cotton value for 2011 is estimated using the 2010 U.S. cotton price of 83 cents per bushel. Cotton prices have been running higher this year but have fallen in recent weeks. Early in the year, cotton was trading near $2 per pound, but in recent weeks the price has fallen to near $1. If Texas had experienced a near-optimum year in 2011 (see 2010 for near-optimum results), the state could have achieved a production total of approximately 4.80 billion pounds (1.00 billion 480-pound bales). This is a rounded value assuming a 2011 optimum harvested acreage of 6.85 million acres (4 percent abandonment) and an optimum yield of 700 pounds per acre. At the 2010 U.S. cotton price of 83 cents per pound, this year’s Texas crop had a potential value of $4.0 billion. Given the 2011 estimated Texas cotton value of approximately $1.8 billion, it is fairly safe to say that the raw losses from this year’s cotton crop are in the ballpark of $2.2 billion.
