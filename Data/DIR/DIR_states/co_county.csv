Soil moisture at the end of winter was so little that the grasses and forbs on the uplands (away from the river) never greened up -- they never broke winter dormancy. Since we acquired our 280 acres at the beginning of 1995, we had never before seen a monsoon season (typically mid-July to mid-September) when we did not receive plenty of rain to turn the pastures bright green. However, the monsoon season is almost over and the upland grasses and forbs remain dormant -- we've had a few storms that dropped up to 1/4 inch of rain but the storms were separated by enough time that the soil never accumulated enough moisture for the grasses and forbs to break dormancy. In short, 11 months into the water year, and the upland grasses and forbs have not greened at all (except in some small locations where rocks concentrated the rainfall in the soil). As a plant ecologist, I'm left wondering whether most of the perennial grasses can survive a year and a half of dormancy until next spring (assuming they never break dormancy this year). Also wondering that if a strong storm does come that breaks their dormancy at the end of this ""growing season"", will that be good or actually hurt the long-term survival of the perennial grasses by them using their root reserves to begin growth while there is too little growing season left to replenish the reserves of nutrients in their roots.The drought does appear to be killing off some unpalatable shrubs: almost all of the broom snakeweed (a native) appears to be dead, as does much or most of the black sagebrush (also a native). For many years I have wondered why those shrubs were not larger components of the ecosystem on our property, given their propensity to encroach over time when fire is not present in the grassland. Now I hypothesize that occasional severe droughts have been the mechanism that kept our pastures heavily dominated by native perennial grasses.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Slick Rock 1.3 N on 8/31/2018",Plants & Wildlife,"San Miguel County, CO",

I buried it on the west, sunny, side of my pines and could only get 6"" to 7"" deep but what I saw looked moist and frozen, hard to tell . The birds are eating even less so I keep cutting back . The bird baths have been mostly frozen and have had trouble freeing them up . One , a big stainless steel bowl , has been the easiest and can always free it of ice but the black satellite dish, 4' off the ground , has been harder than normal to free it of ice . I have seen less blue jays maybe a couple from time to time . The feeders are 7' off the ground to help keep the deer out of them, but they get what is spilled by the birds so I fill at a minimum twice daily . I can still tell the deer are almost here every night . They trigger our motion lights plus I see there hoof prints . They try to get the water before it's to frozen plus I have seen them munching on our lilac stem . The rabbits are the most destructive, we have had to chicken wire all our smaller trees because they kept mowing them to the ground . Now some have grown 5' to 6' over 3 years , mostly ash trees , plus we have a lot less rabbits . The evergreens are looking decent especially the ones that got watered then shortly after we got 2 somewhat decent snow's . The buds on the deciduous trees are smaller/tighter but still okay and their stems are still flexible . We still have some of the drifts left from a couple months ago, in the shaded area that now is all white again from the recent snows . I have been having to pick up more tumbleweeds, knap weed and Russian thistle, and pull them out of the upright junipers to minimize fire danger. Hopefully the winds start backing off. Looking forward to spring and hopeful moisture . Need some pounding thunderstorms. It was 6 degrees this A.M. so had better get out to feed birds and break up the ice, at least it's sunny. We are still going through more wood and propane, it's half gone almost again, the propane . The propane company was very busy the last time and it took a while for them to get to us, almost a month . I have been staying up later and trying to keep the stove going trying to stretch out the propane until springtime . I have done my once yearly watering around the house now it's time for mother nature to her job . Our water is still flowing good and nice and clear unlike 2 yrs. ago when it pounded lots of rain and fouled our well and was told by the county to put about a gallon of bleach down it after it was tested , that was a hassle flushing it out of the well and lines .CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Peyton 9.2 SSW on 2/25/2018","Fire, Plants & Wildlife","El Paso County, CO",

30214,"Ongoing drought brought about the proliferation of tumbleweeds in southeastern Colorado, parts of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle",03/27/2014,03/27/2014, ,"Ongoing drought brought about the proliferation of tumbleweeds in southeastern Colorado, parts of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.  Rainfall in September 2013 spurred the growth of the Russian thistles, which grew well with little moisture in places where much of the native vegetation was sparse or had died from the drought.  There were also fewer cattle in many areas as drought led ranchers to sell livestock, leaving fewer ruminants to nibble on the Russian thistle shoots.  The tumbleweeds are abundant in many areas, blocking roads and drainage culverts and piling up against fences and homes.In Fountain, Colorado, just southeast of Colorado Springs, a windstorm blew an incredible number of tumbleweeds into town, building mounds more than 10 feet high that residents strove to rake together and bag to get rid of them.An older couple in Clovis, New Mexico was trapped in their home in January when it became engulfed in tumbleweeds.  ""I looked out the window to see why it got so dark all of a sudden, and they were over 12-feet high, blocking my front and back doors,"" the man said. ""We couldn't get out.""A neighbor managed to dig through and get into the garage to free the couple.Tumbleweeds have been an ongoing problem in Crowley County, New Mexico where they continue to make travel on some roads very difficult.Baltimore Sun (Md.), March 27, 2014","Plants & Wildlife, Society & Public Health","Alamosa County, CO, Baca County, CO, Bent County, CO, Cheyenne County, CO, Costilla County, CO, Crowley County, CO, Custer County, CO, El Paso County, CO, Elbert County, CO, Fremont County, CO, Huerfano County, CO, Kiowa County, CO, Kit Carson County, CO, Las Animas County, CO, Lincoln County, CO, Otero County, CO, Prowers County, CO, Pueblo County, CO, New Mexico, Clovis, NM, Armstrong County, TX, Bailey County, TX, Borden County, TX, Briscoe County, TX, Carson County, TX, Castro County, TX, Cochran County, TX, Collingsworth County, TX, Crosby County, TX, Dallam County, TX, Dawson County, TX, Deaf Smith County, TX, Donley County, TX, Floyd County, TX, Gaines County, TX, Garza County, TX, Gray County, TX, Hale County, TX, Hall County, TX, Hansford County, TX, Hartley County, TX, Hemphill County, TX, Hockley County, TX, Hutchinson County, TX, Lamb County, TX, Lipscomb County, TX, Lubbock County, TX, Lynn County, TX, Mitchell County, TX, Moore County, TX, Ochiltree County, TX, Oldham County, TX, Parmer County, TX, Potter County, TX, Randall County, TX, Roberts County, TX, Scurry County, TX, Sherman County, TX, Swisher County, TX, Terry County, TX, Wheeler County, TX, Yoakum County, TX",

30151,Tumbleweeds in eastern Colorado,03/04/2014,09/15/2013,06/12/2014,"Crowley and Pueblo counties declared states of emergency to pave the way for state assistance in dealing with the plague of tumbleweeds.  USA Today, June 12, 2014Clearing tumbleweed from roads and bridges has cost Crowley County $108,000 since November, which is more than a third of the county’s annual budget.  El Paso County and Colorado Springs have spent $209,000 dealing with the pesky tumbleweeds.The troublesome tumbleweeds have trapped people in homes and an elementary school and also prompted firefighters to rescue a pregnant woman, who was afraid that she would not be able to get out of her home when she went into labor.Colorado cattle would normally eat the tumbleweed, but drought has forced ranchers to sell many of their livestock, leaving too few animals to keep the tumbleweed in check.  Burning the tumbleweed would be one way to get rid of them, but given the trouble the state has had with wildfires and the way tumbleweeds blow with the wind, it seems an unwise option.  A Crowley County roadman invented a contraption to grind up the tumbleweeds that is very effective.  Other counties were seeking to build something like it to deal with their own tumbleweed emergency.Irrigation ditches must be cleared of tumbleweed before they can be used this spring and summer.El Paso, Crowley and Pueblo counties are contemplating local states of emergency to permit them to appeal for financial help from the state.  Other counties may follow suit.ABC News, April 9, 2014.The abundance of tumbleweeds on the eastern plains of Colorado is causing problems as the rolling, prickly Russian thistles break free from their roots and roll until they pile up against homes and fences.The tumbleweeds block roads, collect in culverts and create monstrous piles sometimes up to 10 feet high and six or more feet deep.  The weeds grew abundantly in late August and early September 2013 when rains fell, but drought had stifled grass growth, allowing the Russian thistles to thrive.Tumbleweeds obstructed the water canals at Evraz Pueblo, a steel pipe making plant, and cost more than $300,000 to get rid of the weeds.  Crowley County spent more than $71,000 to clear them from roads and other structures.Pueblo West and El Paso County were bombarded with the brush in November 2013.  In eastern El Paso County, tumbleweeds blocked rural roads and even impeded traffic on Interstate 25 near Monument.  A woman living 12 miles southeast of Callahan said that her fences were thick with tumbleweeds and she didn’t know how to get rid of them.  The president of Action 22, a regional advocacy organization in southern Colorado, had a teleconference with representatives from the Department of Local Affairs, Office of Emergency Management and Department of Agriculture.  They discussed the tumbleweeds and explored options for financial assistance for dealing with the tumbleweeds, including federal resources and prevention.  The community service director of Fountain said that the weeds were not visibly appealing and were a potential fire hazard, but noted that it was difficult to deal with the things.  The brush is not easy to break down.A maintenance supervisor for Region 2 of the Colorado Department of Transportation said it was challenging keeping fence lines clean because the weeds collect there.  The tumbleweeds also get caught under wooden bridges and must be removed to reduce the fire hazard.  The Crowley County commissioner expressed frustration with the weeds that have been problematic for months, ""They are just absolutely everywhere.  They're like herding cats or maybe trying to catch balloons.  You hit them with the snowplow and they bounce away, then they move back in behind you.  You work 10 hours and all you've done is moved them around.""Tumbleweeds are causing the most problems in the northwestern part of Crowley County, where roughly 35 ranchers and farmers have spent an estimated $55,250 on top of the $71,000 the county spent to deal with them.  More than 850 hours have gone toward clearing the things.A banker returning from Colorado Springs on Colorado 94 in Lincoln County reported to the Crowley County commissioner that about seven to eight miles of the road were so congested with tumbleweeds that they were impassable.  These eastern Colorado counties were still searching for some way to grind the tumbleweeds up to alleviate the problem.

Wendy Ryan, the assistant state climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center showed photos of the tumbleweeds during a Midwest and Great Plains Climate and Drought update.  “County roads and irrigation ditches are full of tumbleweeds,” said Ryan. “They’re having to take snowplows out to try to get the tumbleweeds off (the roads).

28909,Farmers and energy companies compete for water in drought-stricken states,06/20/2013,06/17/2013, ,"Fracking, which is the use of water, sand and chemicals to hydraulically fracture shale formations to access oil and gas, is occurring in drought-affected states where water supplies can be tight.  An Associated Press analysis of industry-compiled fracking information showed Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming were areas of concern.  Drought and increased demand for water has driven up the price of water in some areas.A farmer near Mead, Colorado chose to fallow some of his cornfields because demand for water has driven the price to $1,200 to $2,900 per acre-foot, whereas he used to purchase excess water from cities for $9 to $100 per acre-foot.  As energy companies compete for scarce water supplies, the price can skyrocket.  Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, made $9.5 million on a five-year deal in the summer of 2012 with an oil company, Anadarko, for 2.4 billion gallons of excess treated sewer water.  Local water officials in South Texas think that fracking was worsening the drop of the water table in some areas.  Up to 15,000 acre-feet of water are drawn annually from the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer for fracking in the southern half of the Eagle Ford Shale.  A scientist with the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio stated that 15,000 acre-feet is about half of the aquifer annual recharge.A West Texas cotton grower in Glasscock County plans to sell some of his groundwater to drillers because there is not enough water to irrigate his fields.

Seems like the nearby Little Thompson River flowed most of if not all year, until summer of 2003 and every year since. The river now will run dry  in the summer with maybe a little flow in winter until the spring runoff. The river had small but fishable brown trout, crawfish and minnows - but no longer. There were active beaver dams but they were abandoned when the river dried up. I understand that several communities upriver ""own"" water rights and have dams and reservoirs which obviously affects river flow. Apparently there is no minimum-flow-before-storage regulation. Similarly, Dry Hollow Creek which would flow into the Little Thompson changed within the same time frame. It was once a seasonal creek, flowing only a trickle and sometimes drying up during dry spells. It is now just dry, flowing for a day or so only after an exceptional rain storm. I wonder if the streams will ever get back to what the long-time ""locals"" call more normal.Weeds and grasses: More of this year: knee high grass, sunflowers, rocky mountain bee plant and the invasive knap weed and bind weed. Noticed less of: musk thistle, Canadian thistle, mullien. My guess: this is because of the timing of the spring moisture more than the amount. I also notice that the rabbit bush seems to more invasive in the last few years.No estimate on cost impact for any of the above. Less effort on invasive weed control, more exposure to grass-fire danger and people near the river with shallow dug wells may have to have water hauled in.

The first load of half-ton hay bales cost $3,000.  She grazed the horses on hay that was not worth cutting and was not able to grow enough hay to store for winter use.  To reduce her feeding costs during the 2013-14 winter, she began hydroponically growing fodder on her farm in food-grade plastic trays with fluorescent lighting.

For the east side of the San Luis Valley this is the worst year of the three.  Over the course of the winter it has been so dry that the tributaries of Trinchera Creek that feed Smith Reservoir did not flow to the reservoir for the entire winter - last fall's drought continued through the winter.  Before the start of spring runoff, Smith Reservoir should be at least 1200 acre feet (AF) if not full (4000 AF).  April 1st it was at 120AF! It is currently less than 200AF and still waiting for the creeks to rise enough to start filling.  Very little water has been released for irrigation - when it was, it was an absolute minimum needed (generally in the 10cfs or less range).  Because of the lack of flow on the creeks, the water on the streams is being administered in a manner that has not been used in anyone's memory -- there is not enough water to use the normal springtime exchange for storage and alternate point of diversion that has been used since the reservoir was constructed in 1911. (There is no storage water to exchange!)  For the first time in anyone's memory, the Trinchera Irrigation Company has not been able to deliver the April irrigation allocation - which was set at 1"" per share, which is the lowest allocation amount that can be practically managed.  Storage out of Mountain Home Reservoir was tapped to make some delivery - again unprecedented in the spring of the year.  Many fields that are normally planted have been left fallow (in anticipation of no water) and/or put into cover crops that may not have enough water to sustain the cover.  Sangre de Cristo Creek, which should be peaking at 100-120 cfs right now, is running at ~20cfs and the water is clear - it should be carrying runoff sediment and be turbid to muddy.

The North American Monsoon season in July has provided some much needed relief to our drought.  We have received 2.71 inches of precipitation in July.  However, I am not convinced yet that we are out of the woods.  The rain came too late to help the hay crop in this area much.  We paid $5.50 per small square hay bale last year ($154 per ton), this year we will pay at least $8.00 or more per bale (approximately $224 per ton).  Some people are paying from $10.00 to $12.00 per small square bale this year (approximately $280 to $336 per ton).  This is partly due to fuel costs but the majority of the increase is due to drought.  We are estimating a 40% to 50% increase in the cost of feeding our animals this coming year, plus we've had to feed all summer due to poor grass conditions. In addition, our hay supplier has informed us that he may not have enough hay available to cover what we need and has encouraged us to seek other options as a backup.

They were opting to wean calves sooner than normal, giving the mother cows less nutrition than they would like and buying feed from out of state producers to keep their animals with the hope that the drought will break soon.  One rancher weaned about half of his calves 60 days early to reduce the mother cows’ nutritional needs.  He did not have enough alfalfa to sell the excess as he usually does.  Another rancher who grows forage crops said that the yield was down.  He owned shares of water in 10 ditches, but did not get water from two ditches where he had some of the most recent water rights and received water intermittently from two other ditches.  He tried to use his water most efficiently and effectively, but lost two-thirds of his alfalfa crop and had no extra feed to sell for extra income as he usually does.  He was trying to hold onto all of his livestock and avoid selling any animals because he learned from experience after the 2002 drought that it is hard to finance a large livestock purchase once he had sold half of his herd.  An agricultural resources manager for Boulder County Parks and Open Space, which leases land to farmers and ranchers, stated that crops used for supplemental feeding were hurt by drought and that mountain pastures where ranchers take their cattle in the summer were also severely affected by the drought.

Vilsack announced three significant improvements to decades-old USDA programs and processes related to Secretarial disaster designations: a final rule that simplifies the process for Secretarial disaster designations and will result in a 40 percent reduction in processing time for most counties affected by disasters; a reduced interest rate for emergency loans that effectively lowers the current rate from 3.75 percent to 2.25 percent; and a payment reduction on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands qualified for emergency haying and grazing in 2012, from 25 to 10 percent. ... The final rule for Secretarial disaster designations is amended as follows: 1) Nearly automatically qualifies a disaster county once it is categorized by the U.S. Drought Monitor as a severe drought for eight consecutive weeks during the growing season. Effective July 12, 1,016 primary counties in 26 states will be designated as natural disaster areas, making all qualified farm operators in the designated areas eligible for low interest emergency loans from USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA), provided eligibility requirements are met. 2) Streamlines the USDA Secretarial designation process, which is expected to provide better service to farmers and ranchers by reducing by approximately 40 percent the amount of time required for designating a disaster area. 3) Removes the requirement that a request for a disaster designation be initiated by a state governor or Indian tribal council, increasing the likelihood that counties will be covered. Indian tribal councils and governors may still submit a request for a designation, but it will not be required in order to initiate a disaster declaration. ...

Today, water managers are watching for a developing drought that could exceed historical proportions."" Quote from the Colorado River District in Sky-Hi News, advertising a public meeting on May 9, to discuss agricultural, water supply, water recreation, or aquatic habitats interests. I have heard from ranchers who are contemplating having to sell livestock because they fear they won't have enough pasture/hay to feed them and at least one rancher whose irrigation water was shut off at the end of April due to lack of available water.  There was very sparse runoff from snow melt this spring and it ended early.  Even in low snow years we have a seasonal stream that runs through our meadow for a few days but this year there was nothing.  The two areas that will potentially affect us personally most at this point are concerns about enough domestic water and the possibility of high prices for hay and possibly having a hay shortage.  The concern I hear voiced most often from people I talk to in the community is the potential for a large fire.  The thousands of acres of beetle kill trees plus very dry conditions have everybody in this area a little nervous.  There have already been two grassfires (in the last few weeks) within a 10 mile radius of this station that required local firefighters to respond. Windy conditions caused the fires to spread rapidly.  We are literally one lightning strike from wildfire just about anywhere in this county right now.  The fact that we had record growth of grasses and underbrush last summer that is now dry just adds more fuel for any fire that might start.  If the drought continues there will undoubtedly be other economic impacts for this area.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Parshall 3.0 NNW on 5/8/2012","Agriculture, Fire, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Grand County, CO",

The July & August monsoon rains have taken the edge off the drought, although it remains dry.  The rains have been enough to turn the grasslands green and allow the irrigators to cut back slightly.  However the ground is so dry that there is almost no runoff from the monsoon rains; the streams remain nearly dry. The irrigation water ran out in Smith Reservoir at the end of July.

There was very little winter or spring snow in the Sangre de Cristos, and there has been very little runoff. Ute Creek peaked at about 50cfs around the first of June, its 88 year average is about 70cfs. Today (6/21) its average is about 60cfs - it's running 16cfs. And Ute Creek is the bright spot! Sangre de Cristo Creek should peak earlier about 5/24 at more than 100cfs (again based on the 88 yr avg). This year it was running 6cfs on the 24th. Today, it should be about 30cfs - its running about 0.25cfs. Trinchera Creek (which fills Mountain Home Reservoir)should have been running 90+cfs at the ~June 1st peak, but peaked at 25cfs. Today it should be running 65cfs - and is running at 17cfs. Mountain Home Reservoir should have been filling at about 1ft per day starting in mid-May and continuing into mid-June. Instead it has been gaining about 1/10 of a foot per day. The irrigation company usually allocates 2""/share of storage water in June, another 2""/share in July, and another 2"" in August, and often 1""/share in September. This irrigation year they allocated 1""/share for the entire season! The reservoir is usually near 55ft at the beginning of spring runoff, and then gains about a foot/day before any storage water is used. This year the irrigation company started using storage water on 5/28 with a gauge height of 55ft! I have been asked by several persons (prior to 5/28) why the farmers have been allowed to drain Mtn Home Reservoir, and don't they realize what an affect that has on the fishing-related business? (That is what is known as a teachable moment.) (1. No water had been taken - there was no runoff. (2. The reservoir was constructed by the farmers for irrigation - they have a right to use it! (less a 1964 contractual Div of Wildlife survival pool.) A water right on the lower end of Trinchera Creek which is the first junior water right has been in Futile Call since April 22, 2011. Although it was in Futile Call in 2002 and 2006, this may be the first time it was placed in Futile Call prior to Spring Runoff! A management decision was made to allow San Luis Lake (in San Luis Lake State Park) dry up this summer. It was anticipated that there would not be enough runoff reaching the area to bring the water up to 2 feet below the boat ramp. If no runoff or Closed Basin project water is introduced, the lake may dry up or dry sufficiently to kill (or greatly reduce) the carp population, with the hopes of rebuilding the fishery next year.CoCoRaHS Report from Great Sand Dunes 7.0 SSW on 6/21/2011","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Tourism & Recreation, Water Supply & Quality","Alamosa County, CO",

Thus far, the summer temperatures have been more moderate than last year. Over the last several weeks we have had about an inch and half of rain. But that has been very spotty and while at my reporting spot of the county it looks greener, ten miles away it may be very dry.  Driving down the highway is interesting as two or three miles may be green then it is brown and dry for five or six miles then a green spot followed by a dry spot. It is this way in at least a hundred mile radius from this reporting spot. In Baca County there will be almost no dry land wheat cut this year. Most farmers planted sorghum in dry fields; only those planting under irrigation will have crops this summer.  Most ranchers I know have sold their cattle herds and few cattle can be seen around the area as the pastures are still in very bad shape.  I would estimate that the pastures are at least three years from recovery should they receive normal rainfall. Any cover on many pastures is nonexistent, even those that are showing some greening. Those ranchers who still have cattle are feeding with imported hay.  Many have stated that they are having to travel as far as southwestern Nebraska to buy the hay now.The rain was very welcome and the greening is very pleasant, but a week of blowing wind and rising temperatures will soon sap out any benefit of the rain.CoCoRaHS Report from Station #Springfield 0.5 SE on 6/22/2013",Agriculture,"Baca County, CO, Springfield, CO",
