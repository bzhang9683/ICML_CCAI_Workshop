44566,"Lack of rainfall affecting livestock operation in Tehama County, California",04/09/2018,11/15/2017,04/03/2018,"Our ranch is located in northern California about 45 miles south of Redding, CA,  about 16 miles west of the I-5 corridor. Our nearest post office is Paskenta, CA.  Since our first rainfall on November 8, 2017 we have received 6.25"" of rain.  Our average for the year is around 22"". We have approximately 45 days remaining in our rainy season.        Our ranch consists of 6500 acres and has the carrying capacity, on a normal year, of 500 fall pairs for the grazing season, which consists of the months from November through mid May.  This provides 180 day season multiplied by 500 pairs equals 90,000 animal grazing days.      Our grass is O.K. at best.  To clarify, the quality is good, quantity is poor.  The rain has waited until the last possible day to arrive on every occasion thus far meaning we have had little rain, but it has arrived at just the right time to keep us going.       The drought is affecting our operation in multiple ways.      1. The first impact is our carrying capacity.   November 15 we brought in 300 fall pairs.  This is a little over half of what should have been brought in.  March 10 we brought in another 100 fall pairs and 60 spring calving cows.  This works out to: 300 pairs multiplied by 180 days equals 54,000 animal grazing days plus 100 pairs and 60 bred cows multiplied by only 60 days equals 9,600 animal grazing days for a total of 63,600 animal grazing days.  This is a 30% loss in carrying capacity.2. Rain  Runoff.  We depend on rain runoff to recharge stock ponds and to provide stream flow in seasonal creeks to provide drinking water.  We have been hauling water to one group of cows for 3 weeks.  The others will be fine for this year.3. Calf market weights.  We are projecting our market calves to be 40-70 pounds lighter due to lack of available feed and also having to sell animals sooner.  4. The greatest impact of 2017-2018 drought, in my opinion,  will be fall of 2018.  We have not received any runoff to recharge our stock ponds.  This will not allow us to graze cattle until we receive significant rain which will shorten our cattle grazing days for a second consecutive year.      The drought is really spotty in northern California.  Conditions change drastically within 30 miles of our operation; some for the better, most for the worst.       To summarize, to graze one cow for one day is $1.33  We will lose 26,400 animal grazing days this season for a loss of $35,112.  Add 400 fall pairs, which will yield 300 calves to sell weighing 560 pounds (last years average was 600 pounds) for a price of $1.50/lb equals $840.00 ($900.00 using last years weights) for a loss of $60.00 per calf multiplied by 300 equals $18,000 loss.  2018-2019 presents other potential losses with less animal grazing days.  There is a very good possibility we will not have any cattle until January 1, 2019, due to stock pond recharge,  which will be a 45-day loss of days.  45 days multiplied by 500 pairs equals 22,500 animal grazing days multiplied by $1.33 for a loss of $29,925.  This puts our total financial loss to $83,037.00, not counting losses from conception issues, lack of feed for replacements, lack of yield in hay production, etc...From Tehama County, California, on April 3, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Tehama County, CA, Paskenta, CA",

Jerry Brown, is the order of the day.  With the reduction in outdoor water use has come a neglect for trees that has killed millions of them statewide.  Stressed and wilting from water loss, numerous redwoods, oaks, magnolias and other species of trees have been losing leaves and limbs, according to arborists.Water utilities have lost more than half a billion dollars in just the last eight months as customers conserve water, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.   The drop in revenue should continue through October, due to the board’s extension of the water conservation targets, and will likely lead to water rate increases as some districts work to balance the loss.  Intense water conservation has also led to other problems, too.  Sewer lines designed to carry away solid waste using about 120 gallons per household per day have only had a flow of about 50 gallons per person per day, leaving solids sitting in pipes.  As the material lingers, it gives off hydrogen sulfide and also corrodes the pipes.With the intention of saving water, Californians dutifully replaced lawns with desert-themed foliage, aided by rebates offered by their water districts, but homeowners were unaware that the Internal Revenue Service would tax the rebates as income.

Folsom Lake had fallen to a historically low level in December, but has since refilled, prompting the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to up water releases to 1,750 cubic feet per second to create “safe space” for potential winter storms that could cause flooding.  Long-standing federal guidelines state that the lake ought not to contain more than 577,000 acre-feet in early February, but at 11 a.m. on Feb. 5, Folsom Lake held 581,000 acre-feet.Folsom Lake was the only large reservoir in California to reach average storage after years of drought.

As of noon on Aug. 31, Folsom Lake held roughly 196,000 acre-feet of water.  The higher releases during August were to keep saltwater from pushing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and to retain more cold water in Lake Shasta for an endangered species of salmon.  With the smaller releases in September, Reclamation intended to “conserve water in storage,” and keep Folsom Lake above 120,000 acre-feet so the pumping infrastructure for suburban Sacramento would continue to work.

Loggers began arriving in 2015 as the U.S. Forest Service reported 66 million dead trees, and the estimated numbers of dead trees has continued to climb.  The employment opportunity has also led some loggers to move their families from places like Oregon and Georgia because the work will last a while.  Along with an emergency order, Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.  The California Department of Transportation set aside $11 million to get rid of the trees before they fall and impede traffic to and from Yosemite National Park or hurt a motorist.

The agencies release water from their dams on the Sacramento, Feather and American rivers, send it through the Delta,  and pump it out to send elsewhere, but are suffering water losses somewhere along the line.  They suspect that Delta farmers on the 70 Delta islands are taking water that does not belong to them.  The Delta farmers have water rights that allow them to take as much of the “natural” flow as they need to grow crops, and those water rights predate the DWR’s and Reclamation’s water rights.In response, the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, a group that sympathizes with Delta landowners, has filed a formal complaint against DWR and Reclamation, charging that the agencies illegally divert water from the San Joaquin, Mokelumne, Cosumnes and Calaveras rivers, taking water to which they hold no rights.

In spite of the warm days, nights have been especially cold for this area. When it is clear, we have frost and lower temperatures. It has been frosty almost every night this winter. The temporary homeless shelter in town was over capacity almost every night and has had to add beds. Fishermen wait every year for the heavy rains and fish running upstream. This year, we have had no rain significant enough to cause conditions to allow enough water flow for fish to swim upstream easily. Those who have made it part way have had to stop in deep pools, attracting large numbers of fishermen to these pools. The fishing was good, the fish not so happy. We have been asked to conserve water. Plants are growing in the beds of the streams that feed the river. The stream beds are usually washed clean during the winter, leaving only gravel. It will be interesting to watch the river and stream beds as these plants gain hold.

30861,Drought hurting California almond growers,09/15/2014,01/01/2014,12/31/2014,"The drought has presented serious challenges to California almond farmers who must find water for their trees and have resorted to drilling new wells, depending on salty groundwater or bulldozing trees.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service and California agriculture officials sent surveys to 688 almond growers, 458 of whom filled out and returned the surveys.Survey results showed that almost 70 percent of almond growers have only groundwater to use for irrigation this year—no surface water or canal water.  Roughly 23 percent drilled new wells, an expensive option, while 32 percent improved existing wells.  Nearly 75 percent of almond growers are using groundwater with a higher salt content than is recommended for almond trees.  Growers often try to use groundwater and less salty surface water, but this year, there is no surface water to be had.  Salt can accumulate in almond trees and harm or kill them.  Almond trees suffering from salt build-up often see smaller nut size, reduced growth and the potential for smaller than usual crops in future years.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast a 2.1 billion pound almond harvest in California this year, but the survey revealed that 9 percent of growers bulldozed trees for lack of water or suitable water.  Many almond growers cut back their acreage as well.  Growers with at least 600 acres reduced their operations by 17 percent.  Overall, California almond growers eliminated 38 percent of their acreage.  Almonds are one of the largest crops in California, covering 860,000 acres mostly in the San Joaquin Valley.  Almonds are the main crop in Fresno County, worth $1.1 billion in 2013.Fresno Bee (Calif.), Sept. 12, 2014","Agriculture, Water Supply & Quality","Butte County, CA, Colusa County, CA, Fresno County, CA, Caruthers, CA, Glenn County, CA, Kern County, CA, Madera County, CA, Merced County, CA, San Joaquin County, CA, Solano County, CA, Stanislaus County, CA, Sutter County, CA, Tehama County, CA, Yolo County, CA, Yuba County, CA",

Starting in May, single-family households will be allocated 249 gallons of water per day, based on a four-person household, but more water can be requested.  Condominiums, apartment buildings and duplexes will receive from 124 to 174 gallons per residence per day, depending on the number of units per building.  Residents using up to 10 percent more water than allotted will pay $25 per unit of water, while those using more than 10 percent in excess of the allotted water will pay $50 per unit of water.  Santa Cruz Sentinel (Calif.), April 22, 2014Ongoing drought led the Santa Cruz City Council to declare a water shortage emergency, introducing rationing and penalty pricing for using excessive amounts of water beginning on May 1, 2014.

We started gathering all of our animals for sale.  We sold all of our non-replacement heifers early in preparation.  Fortunately we have had some recent rains that have helped; however, the grass is still very short and we plan to start selling off cow/calf pairs.

New parks have only small patches of grass, while the grassy park outside of City Hall was turned into a garden of succulents.  Some L.A. residents feel that the mission to get rid of grass has deprived children of play spaces.  One woman stated, “It’s getting to the point where kids live in apartments, and they don’t even see grass, except in magazines.  I don’t want to end up like New York or Chicago, with no grass.”In July 2013, the rebate for replacing a square foot of grass rose from $2 to $2.50 in Los Angeles to encourage even more people to forego the grass.  The rebate in Long Beach increased to $3 per square foot.  In Las Vegas, Nevada  the front yards of new developments may not be planted with new grass, and medians on the Strip are covered with synthetic turf, not real grass.  The transition began in 2003 when the Las Vegas Valley Water District offered the nation’s first turf removal program and has since paid nearly $200 million for the removal of 165.6 million square feet of grass around homes and businesses.  Once the grass has been removed from a residential yard, the amount of the rebate plus interest must be paid back to the city before the owner can have a yard of grass again.  In Austin, Texas, residents must water during the night to reduce water lost to evaporation and may be fined $475 for running their sprinklers during the daytime.Nearly 250,000 square feet of grass in Mesa, Arizona has been replaced with desertscape to conserve water.
