Our nearest post office is Paskenta, CA.  Since our first rainfall on November 8, 2017 we have received 6.25"" of rain.  Our average for the year is around 22"". We have approximately 45 days remaining in our rainy season.        Our ranch consists of 6500 acres and has the carrying capacity, on a normal year, of 500 fall pairs for the grazing season, which consists of the months from November through mid May.  This provides 180 day season multiplied by 500 pairs equals 90,000 animal grazing days.      Our grass is O.K. at best.  To clarify, the quality is good, quantity is poor.  The rain has waited until the last possible day to arrive on every occasion thus far meaning we have had little rain, but it has arrived at just the right time to keep us going.       The drought is affecting our operation in multiple ways.      1. The first impact is our carrying capacity.   November 15 we brought in 300 fall pairs.  This is a little over half of what should have been brought in.  March 10 we brought in another 100 fall pairs and 60 spring calving cows.  This works out to: 300 pairs multiplied by 180 days equals 54,000 animal grazing days plus 100 pairs and 60 bred cows multiplied by only 60 days equals 9,600 animal grazing days for a total of 63,600 animal grazing days.  This is a 30% loss in carrying capacity.2. Rain  Runoff.  We depend on rain runoff to recharge stock ponds and to provide stream flow in seasonal creeks to provide drinking water.  We have been hauling water to one group of cows for 3 weeks.  The others will be fine for this year.3. Calf market weights.  We are projecting our market calves to be 40-70 pounds lighter due to lack of available feed and also having to sell animals sooner.  4. The greatest impact of 2017-2018 drought, in my opinion,  will be fall of 2018.  We have not received any runoff to recharge our stock ponds.  This will not allow us to graze cattle until we receive significant rain which will shorten our cattle grazing days for a second consecutive year.      The drought is really spotty in northern California.  Conditions change drastically within 30 miles of our operation; some for the better, most for the worst.       To summarize, to graze one cow for one day is $1.33  We will lose 26,400 animal grazing days this season for a loss of $35,112.  Add 400 fall pairs, which will yield 300 calves to sell weighing 560 pounds (last years average was 600 pounds) for a price of $1.50/lb equals $840.00 ($900.00 using last years weights) for a loss of $60.00 per calf multiplied by 300 equals $18,000 loss.  2018-2019 presents other potential losses with less animal grazing days.  There is a very good possibility we will not have any cattle until January 1, 2019, due to stock pond recharge,  which will be a 45-day loss of days.  45 days multiplied by 500 pairs equals 22,500 animal grazing days multiplied by $1.33 for a loss of $29,925.  This puts our total financial loss to $83,037.00, not counting losses from conception issues, lack of feed for replacements, lack of yield in hay production, etc...From Tehama County, California, on April 3, 2018","Agriculture, Plants & Wildlife, Water Supply & Quality","Tehama County, CA, Paskenta, CA",

About 25 percent of families using private wells in the Central Valley were consuming water containing dangerous amounts of uranium.  Up to 10 percent of public water systems use raw water that contains more uranium than allowed by government safety standards.  Long-term uranium exposure can damage kidneys, increase cancer risks and cause other problems.  The average amount of uranium in the public-supply wells in the eastern San Joaquin Valley increased 17 percent from 1990 to the mid-2000s, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  Uranium enters the water supply when snowmelt picks up uranium-laden sediment before it is used to irrigate crops, which produce a weak acid that draws uranium from the sediment.    As wells are used, the contaminated water is drawn down into the ground where it eventually is pumped for use as drinking water.

Folsom Lake had fallen to a historically low level in December, but has since refilled, prompting the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to up water releases to 1,750 cubic feet per second to create “safe space” for potential winter storms that could cause flooding.  Long-standing federal guidelines state that the lake ought not to contain more than 577,000 acre-feet in early February, but at 11 a.m. on Feb. 5, Folsom Lake held 581,000 acre-feet.Folsom Lake was the only large reservoir in California to reach average storage after years of drought.  Other reservoirs were still sorely in need of more precipitation.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 6, 2016The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released an average of 3,000 acre-feet of water daily from Folsom Lake through August, but will slow the releases to 800 cubic feet per second by the morning of Sept. 4.  As of noon on Aug. 31, Folsom Lake held roughly 196,000 acre-feet of water.  The higher releases during August were to keep saltwater from pushing into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and to retain more cold water in Lake Shasta for an endangered species of salmon.  With the smaller releases in September, Reclamation intended to “conserve water in storage,” and keep Folsom Lake above 120,000 acre-feet so the pumping infrastructure for suburban Sacramento would continue to work.  Reclamation was constructing a specially outfitted barge that could pump water to the city of Folsom if the lake were to fall below the city’s intake valves.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 31, 2015Folsom Lake will be drawn down more slowly this summer to ease the concern of Sacramento-area water agencies worried about the water supply.  The lake will likely dwindle down to 120,000 acre-feet at the end of September, but will not be allowed to drop further.

39127,Loggers thronging to fell California's millions of dead trees,02/07/2017,01/01/2015,02/06/2017,"Roughly 102 million dead trees in California, needing to be felled for safety’s sake, lured loggers from across the nation, looking for steady work and a good paycheck.  Loggers began arriving in 2015 as the U.S. Forest Service reported 66 million dead trees, and the estimated numbers of dead trees has continued to climb.  The employment opportunity has also led some loggers to move their families from places like Oregon and Georgia because the work will last a while.  Along with an emergency order, Gov. Jerry Brown in 2016 pledged tens of millions of dollars to remove the dead trees, and the influx of loggers began.  At least six public and private agencies were paying to have the trees removed and turned into biofuel or into chips for emergency offramps to slow runaway trucks.  The California Department of Transportation set aside $11 million to get rid of the trees before they fall and impede traffic to and from Yosemite National Park or hurt a motorist.  In January, CalTrans had 30,000 trees designated for removal along State Routes 41 and 168.  The agency paid as much as $1,000 per tree and already paid about $6.5 million for the removal of about 8,000 trees.  The Forest Service and two utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, were also spending millions to get rid of the trees.

Participating growers receive financial incentives.Chico Enterprise Record (Calif.), Oct. 15, 2015BirdReturns, a new rescue program devised by the Nature Conservancy of California, has made bird habitat available during drought by offering money to farmers to flood their rice fields early with well water and keep the fields inundated into April 2015.  The program was developed within the past month because many historic wetlands in the Central Valley and three refuges in the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex were parched amid ongoing drought, and duck reproduction in central Canada and the Dakotas was particularly successful this spring.An aerial survey of six wildlife refuges in the Sacramento Valley complex performed in August found fewer than 10,000 ducks and 250 geese at the Sacramento and Delevan refuges, 24 ducks and no geese at Colusa, and no waterfowl at Sutter, Butte Sink and Llano Seco, which were dry.

With the drought, there are fewer remaining water sources in the Central Valley, meaning birds will be crowded into smaller areas, making it easier to transmit diseases and more challenging to find enough food.  In a typical year, about 5 million waterfowl winter on state and federal wildlife refuges and flooded rice fields in the Central Valley.  Water supplies to wildlife refuges in the Central Valley were reduced by 25 percent.  Rice acreage was cut by a similar amount as farmers received less irrigation water.  Breeding season in Canada has been very successful, leading to a large number of birds heading to the Central Valley soon, said the Western region director of Ducks Unlimited.  He expects disease and a food shortage, due to dried up rice fields and withered wetlands.The California Department of Fish and Wildlife asked the public to observe waterfowl and report sick birds with the hope of stemming an avian botulism outbreak if caught in the early stages.

Because it is expensive to have water trucked to homes, county officials would like to offer more sites where water can be purchased.

The general manager of South Feather said that about two-thirds of the 100 loads of water purchased in May were for construction.  In June, just one-third of the roughly 100 loads of water purchased were for construction, suggesting that the difference might be for residential delivery.The Butte County emergency service officer estimated that there were about 60 properties with dry wells, including Forest Ranch, Cohasset, Butte Valley, Mesilla Valley, Bangor and Durham.

The owner of a pump repair business said that he has been getting a dozen calls per day about wells with many of those near irrigated orchards, presumably where water demand is higher.  In his experience, groundwater was low near Durham, Orland and Capay, and in some places, the water level has fallen 10 feet and not come back up.  He worries that if the drought continues and water levels continue to fall, that it will adversely affect his business when there is no longer water to pump.A well driller in Chico has been busy working on wells on Garner Lane, Kathy Lane and Stable Lane where the depth of the wells ranged from 65 to 80 feet deep.  In the Cohasset and Forest Ranch areas, there is trouble with wells, particularly those more than 15 years old.  In parts of Cohasset, the water is 700 to 800 feet below ground.  The well driller noted that the entire town of Nord must drill deeper to reach water at a cost of roughly $8,000 per well.

This area is the Boy Scout Camp Road area of Lockwood Valley in North-East Ventura County. The impact is tremendous to my property and to the wildlife.  Several varieties of wildflowers never germinated this year, or if they did, there were no blooms: penstemons (wild snapdragons), lupins, clover, goldenrod, rattlesnake weed, bladder pods, cat tails, and domestic daffodils and tulips and iris didn't sprout or bloom.  The canyon/scrub oaks produced no acorns this year, the manzanita produced no nuts.  Oddly, the pinion pines produced a very small amount of viable nuts.  I now believe that the pinions are on a two to four year cycle of nut production, and it's the quantity of nuts produced that is dependent on precipitation.  More small gray fox (kit fox?) were killed on roads last fall, than I have ever seen in the past 14 years living in this area.  Rabbit numbers have reduced tremendously, and even the coyotes are hunting in other areas, since we hear their howls rarely now.  Scrub jays and stellar jays rarely visit my property now.  My property is along the northern edge of the Day Fire's devastation, and there is still very little vegetation found in the burned out areas, despite the fact that it has been eight years since the Day Fire.  Tiny pine trees and seedlings have all perished.  There are no more one to three year old pine trees on my property.  The vegetation is so sparse that very little of my property has ground cover now.  I used to have at least some grasses (dead or alive) that provided erosion control on the exposed areas.  Now, I fear that heavy rainfall will erode most of my exposed topsoil.  Since there has been almost no regeneration of the forest destroyed by the Day Fire, it's clear that this danger exists for most of the forest land between Piru and Lockwood Valley.  About 1/3 to 1/2 of the trees killed by the day fires, but those left standing remain standing.  The fallen trees roots are termite ridden.  That seems to be the only insect thriving, other than bark beetles.  There were very very few wasps, gnats, dragonflies, butterflies, flies, june bugs and similar beetles, but no difference in scorpions, and similar desert insects.  This summer, the cicadas emerged and their chirps were deafening in the forest, but this only lasted a few weeks, then it was silent again.  There was an extreme number of bark beetles on my property last fall and this spring, and I worry that my pinions will be successfully attacked by their swarms.  In some areas of Lockwood Valley, near the TXI Plant, and along Cuddy Valley and Frazier Park's south facing mountain sides, very large sections of pinions have died.  In LV, as much as 1/3 to 1/2 of these forest areas are now dead.  This will be devastating to the wildlife and will enhance erosion in these areas in future years.  Many of the poplars planted by residents have died, seemingly by drought and insects.  They are not drought resistant.  Jeffery pines (lodgepole?) appear to be as vulnerable as the pinions.  Even the manzanita are dying, as well as a small number of juniper.  To put it bluntly, things are looking grim.  This area is transforming into a desert region, it seems.  I don't know the amount the local well water has dropped, but will find out and enter that info as well.  Extreme water conservation measures are being used.  The water on my property is unsuitable for irrigation, or drinking.  I must haul in drinking water, and I don't irrigate.  I rely on local plants for landscaping, and precipitation for irrigation.  Sadly, most perennial wild flowering plants have completely died.  The flowering plants that remain are navarretia (an annual), scarlet bugles, and two different species of sage.   That's all that remains on my property.  I hope that I will still have viable seeds of the now gone plants to germinate once good precipitation returns.

Farmers may leave up to 500,000 acres unplanted, which is 12 percent of the principal crops grown in 2013, because they will not have sufficient water to bring the crop to harvest, according to Mike Wade, executive director of the California Farm Water Coalition.A farmer in Stanislaus County chose to plant less corn and alfalfa and sell some dairy cows to avoid having to purchase grain to feed the animals because he may lose as much as two-thirds of his usual allotment of irrigation water this year.  The farmer dislikes the reductions he has to make because he says the cuts will affect his farm through 2015.A dairyman in Turlock sold roughly a dozen replacement cattle from his herd of 900 Holstein cows to reduce his need for feed and water for his main milking herd.

Jerry Brown mandated 25 percent water conservation between June 2015 and February 2016, compared to the same months in 2013, and Californians just missed the target at 23.9 percent.  Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, lauded the effort, saying “Californians rose to the occasion, reducing irrigation, fixing leaks, taking shorter showers and saving our precious water resources in all sorts of ways.""  Altogether, the public saved enough water during those nine months to serve nearly 6 million Californians for a full year, which is still a considerable feat.  Water conservation in February amounted to just 12 percent.  The Sacramento Bee, April 4, 2016Water conservation in California slipped further to 17.1 percent in January, while the overall conservation since June 2015 dipped to 24.8 percent, missing the governor’s end of February savings goal of 25 percent.  Even though conservation was down in January, California residences used an average of 61 gallons per person per day, setting a new record, and beating December’s per capita daily water use of 67 gallons.Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Feb. 25, 2016California’s urban residents curbed their water use by 18.3 percent in December compared to December 2013.  This was the month of least conservation since Gov. Jerry Brown ordered his state’s residents to conserve at least 25 percent of water used compared to 2013.  From June through December 2015, Californians cumulatively have saved 25.5 percent, exceeding the governor’s mandate.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Feb. 3, 2016Conservation efforts yielded less water saved in November when Californians curbed water use by 20 percent.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Jan. 5, 2016Water conservation in California dipped to 22 percent in October as warmer temperatures, compared to the benchmark year of 2013, likely led to more lawn watering.  October was also the first month that conservation fell below the mandated 25 percent since enforcement started in June.  Since June, water conservation efforts have saved an average of 27 percent per month, already putting the state at 76 percent of its conservation goal through February 2016.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Dec. 1, 2015Californians cut their water use 26 percent in September, exceeding the governor’s goal of a 25 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013 water use.San Francisco Chronicle (Calif.), Oct. 30, 2015For the third month, Californians have exceeded the governor’s request for 25 percent water conservation and saved 27 percent in August 2015, compared to August 2013.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 1, 2015California urban water use fell 31 percent in July, compared with water use in 2013, for a savings of more than 74 billion gallons.  The 31 percent water savings well exceeds the governor’s mandate for a 25 percent reduction in water use.  Roughly 4 in 5 of the state’s about 420 water districts met the 25 percent goal in July.  Most big cities also made their conservation targets, but four water districts missed their target by more than 15 percent.As water customers use less water, utilities lose revenue when less water is sold, yet fixed costs for maintenance and operations of water delivery systems remain.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Aug. 27, 2015Californians curbed their water use in June by 27 percent, according to the State Water Resources Control Board, exceeding the governor’s demand for 25 percent water conservation.  Of the 400 individual conservation targets assigned to the state’s largest water agencies, about two-thirds successfully made their goals.  Sixteen agencies—mostly in central or southern California—missed their conservation target by more than 15 percentage points.  One small Central Valley community, ordered to cut water use by 32 percent, only lowered its water use by 3 percent.Another 71 water agencies missed their goal by 5 to 15 percentage points, while 53 water providers fell short of their target by 1 to 5 percent.The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), July 30, 2015Californians’ best showing in water conservation occurred in May with a 29 percent reduction in water use, compared to 2013.  The May conservation effort exceeded the governor’s April order to curb water use by 25 percent.  May rains could have influenced the conservation rate, with fewer people watering lawns.  The Sacramento area cut water use by nearly 40 percent, leading the state in water savings, while the southern coast, including Los Angeles and San Diego used 25 percent less water, an improvement over the past few months.  San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com)The public stepped up their water conservation efforts and used 13.5 percent less water in April compared with April 2013, an improvement over water savings of 3 percent in February and 4 percent in March.KFSN-TV ABC 30 Frenso/Visalia (Calif.), June 2, 2015Water conservation in March rose to 8.6 percent, considerably below the 25 percent mandatory cut in water use ordered by Gov. Jerry Brown.Los Angeles Times, May 5, 2015Water use in California fell less than 3 percent in February, compared to February 2013, as poor water conservation efforts raised alarm and led to mandatory targets for conservation by city, depending on the city’s per capita water use.  Along the south coast from Los Angeles to San Diego, water use was higher, indicating the need for drastic changes to water habits in light of the intense drought pummeling the state.  Statewide water conservation was about 9 percent since the governor requested a voluntary reduction in water use in January 2014.The New York Times, April 7, 2015Water use in January 2015 was 8.8 percent lower than the previous January’s, rebounding from a December 2014 conservation success of 22.2 percent, surpassing the governor’s conservation goal of 20 percent.  An exceedingly dry January likely led to some lawn watering, which may have bumped up water use.Per capita water consumption was 73 gallons in January, up from 67 gallons in December.Los Angeles Times, March 5, 2015Abundant December rainfall helped Californians cut their water use by 22 percent, allowing residents to finally bring their water conservation above the 20 percent mark as requested by Gov. Brown in January 2014.  The public has done an impressive job of lowering per capita water use in the past six months.  In June, California per capita water use was 140 gallons per day, but in December, that number was down to an average of 67 gallons per day.  Cities among  the lowest water users in December were San Diego with a per capita water use of 46 gallons per day and San Francisco with a daily use of 40 gallons per day.San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com), Feb. 3, 2015Statewide, water conservation climbed to 9.8 percent in November in comparison with November 2013 water use.  In the South Coast region, comprised of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties, conservation amounted to 3.2 percent, while in the Bay Area and Sacramento, water consumption was 18 and 25 percent.  Temperature differences and more rainfall in Northern California may have contributed to the range in conservation results.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Jan. 6, 2015Despite Gov. Brown’s request for conservation of 20 percent, Californians only curbed their water use by 6.7 percent in October, compared with the previous year and by 11.6 percent in August, state residents’ best showing since the appeal for conservation.  The state Water Resources Control Board said that 90 billion gallons of water have been conserved since June.  The state’s primary reservoirs held 39 percent to 60 percent of normal water levels for this time of year.  In addition, the average Northern Sierra snowpack was 79 percent of normal, while the southern Sierra was 47 percent of normal.ABC News, Dec. 3, 2014Southern Californians cut their water use by 1.4 percent in October, compared with the previous year, but some water customers used more water, according to figures from the State Water Resources Control Board.  Residents in the Costa Mesa Water District used 12.5 percent more water, with per capita water use climbing from 80 gallons per day to 90 gallons daily.  Other communities using more water included Trabuco Canyon Water District, Brea, Santa Margarita Water District, San Clemente, City of San Juan Capistrano Water Department, Moulton Niguel Water District and Anaheim.  Water districts using less water were the East Orange County Water District, where people used an average of 270 gallons of water per person daily in October for a decrease of 5.8 percent.  Newport Beach water customers used 25.7 percent less water.  La Palma and Garden Grove also trimmed their water consumption.Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.), Dec. 2, 2014Water conservation in California waned slightly in September, with savings of 10.3 percent or about 22 million gallons, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.  Per capita water use varied from less than 50 gallons per day up to more than 500 per day.  In Beverly Hills, usage was 286 gallons per person per day and in the East Los Angeles district of the California Water Service Co., it was 48 gallons per person per day.  Southern Californians on average used 119 gallons per person per day.Los Angeles Times, Nov. 4, 2014Californians curbed water use by 11.5 percent in August, compared with the previous year, for an increase in water savings.  Parts of Southern California made substantial progress in water conservation, from using 8 percent more water in May to using 7.8 percent less in August.  Gov. Brown urged residents to cut their water use by 20 percent, putting Californians a little more than halfway to the goal.  More water agencies are providing water use data.  In May, providing data to estimate water conservation was voluntary, with 63 percent of water agencies participating. while in August, about 95 percent shared water use figures.  The City of Tracy cut water use by 41 percent in August and was one of 20 cities trimming their water use by 20 percent.  State officials had special praise for Long Beach, which has long been working to conserve water, but still achieved a reduction in water use of 6.8 percent.  Long Beach had brought its water use down to the lowest point since 1958.Los Angeles Times, Oct. 7, 2014Despite the request for a 20 percent reduction in water use, Californians have curbed their water consumption by 7.5 percent, according to water agencies.  While some cities used more water in July in comparison with  the previous year, many cities cut their consumption in July.  Some of the cities and water districts that reduced their water use include the California Water Service Company Livermore in Alameda County, 38 percent reduction; City of Pleasanton in Alameda County, 37 percent reduction; Dublin San Ramon Services District in Alameda County, 34 percent; City of Woodland in Yolo County, 27 percent; Sacramento Suburban Water District, 26 percent; City of Santa Cruz, 25 percent;  Placer County Water Agency, 22 percent; City of Sacramento, 22 percent; Alameda County Water District, 22 percent; and Citrus Heights Water District in Sacramento County, 21 percent.Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Sept. 9, 2014The South Coast Hydrologic Region, including Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Diego, curbed its water use by 1.7 percent in July, which was better than May when water use rose 8 percent.  Reductions in water use between northern and southern parts of the state were not always fair comparisons because some areas had already taken greater strides toward water conservation than other areas.Water conservation efforts were more apparent after the state adopted emergency conservation regulations in July.  In May, water use rose 1.5 percent; in June, water use fell 4.4 percent, but in July, water consumption fell 7.5 percent.

Soda Springs ski area and two cross-country areas, Royal Gorge and Tahoe XC were also closed.The Sugar Bowl ski resort was open, but only about 25 of the 100 runs were useable.  Fewer skiers were visiting with the thin snowpack, so the parking lot was relatively empty.  Only one restaurant and lodge was open, and just one of the four cash registers was in use.  The spokesman for the Sugar Bowl said that they will continue with the snowmaking operations to improve the runs that were currently open.  The ski patrol was also out with hockey sticks to slap rocks off the trail.Some small number of visitors who made their reservations months ago continued to trickle through, but resort managers and staff worried about the trickle drying up.  In a couple of weeks, there may be far fewer visitors.  Young people have been laid off from their jobs at the ski resorts because there were not enough customers, due to the low snowfall.  Royal Gorge just closed Jan. 7, but will reopen when the area gets a foot of snow.  Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Jan. 8, 2014.Little snow has fallen in the Lake Tahoe area, leading recreationists to do more mountain biking, hiking, beach walking and sunbathing than skiing.  The mountains are largely brown, ski resorts are not fully open and the dry winter is taking a toll on local businesses’ bottom line.  Even Donner Summit has only thin patches of snow and the Donner Ski Ranch was empty.  A few skiers made their way downhill, despite the rocks and bare dirt.The lack of snow cut into business at most resorts and equipment rental shops, but many people who had planned their vacations months ago were making the best of it and skiing anyway.  The ski and board repairs needed after hitting rocks were beneficial for the local shops.  A bicycle rental shop in Truckee was busy, although the activity is not usually popular in January.

30861,Drought hurting California almond growers,09/15/2014,01/01/2014,12/31/2014,"The drought has presented serious challenges to California almond farmers who must find water for their trees and have resorted to drilling new wells, depending on salty groundwater or bulldozing trees.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service and California agriculture officials sent surveys to 688 almond growers, 458 of whom filled out and returned the surveys.Survey results showed that almost 70 percent of almond growers have only groundwater to use for irrigation this year—no surface water or canal water.  Roughly 23 percent drilled new wells, an expensive option, while 32 percent improved existing wells.  Nearly 75 percent of almond growers are using groundwater with a higher salt content than is recommended for almond trees.  Growers often try to use groundwater and less salty surface water, but this year, there is no surface water to be had.  Salt can accumulate in almond trees and harm or kill them.  Almond trees suffering from salt build-up often see smaller nut size, reduced growth and the potential for smaller than usual crops in future years.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast a 2.1 billion pound almond harvest in California this year, but the survey revealed that 9 percent of growers bulldozed trees for lack of water or suitable water.  Many almond growers cut back their acreage as well.  Growers with at least 600 acres reduced their operations by 17 percent.  Overall, California almond growers eliminated 38 percent of their acreage.  Almonds are one of the largest crops in California, covering 860,000 acres mostly in the San Joaquin Valley.

It may take several weeks to make all notifications to increase river flow.  The ODWR has three teams of two people each to visit junior water rights holders and shut off water.

A Christmas tree farmer in El Dorado County said demand exceeded supply, but that they would be open while they had trees to sell.  The growth of firs and other traditional Christmas trees has been slowed significantly by the meager rain and snowfall in recent years, so it takes longer to get a “full-sized” tree.  Drought has been particularly hard on Noble fir trees, with many of them bearing plenty of brown needles.  Silver tip firs, Douglas firs, white firs and native incense cedars have tolerated the scarce precipitation better.  Drought in 2013 and 2014 cost tree growers thousands of seedlings planted in those years.  In recent years, growers have begun buying water to keep the trees growing.

Three hay growers in Butte County, California have had hay stolen repeatedly from their fields, stated a Custom Hay operator.  Hay sells for more than $200 per ton in California.  In Tillman County, Oklahoma, the clever sheriff planted a GPS unit in a bale of hay located in a field where hay rustlers had already struck, hoping that they would strike again.  He managed to catch the thieves red-handed.  Grass hay prices in Kansas have nearly tripled from about $15 to $25 per bale to $65 to $75 for a bale.  Alfalfa prices rose from about $45 to $60 per bale to $140 to $150 per bale.  The Missouri Farm Bureau president stated that hay thieves were a problem in his state.  Sheriff’s deputies in Butler County, Kansas were patrolling county roads to stem hay thefts.

27084,USDA Announces Streamlined Disaster Designation Process,07/13/2012,07/12/2012, ,"Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack July 11 announced a package of program improvements that will deliver faster and more flexible assistance to farmers and ranchers devastated by natural disasters. Vilsack announced three significant improvements to decades-old USDA programs and processes related to Secretarial disaster designations: a final rule that simplifies the process for Secretarial disaster designations and will result in a 40 percent reduction in processing time for most counties affected by disasters; a reduced interest rate for emergency loans that effectively lowers the current rate from 3.75 percent to 2.25 percent; and a payment reduction on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands qualified for emergency haying and grazing in 2012, from 25 to 10 percent. ... The final rule for Secretarial disaster designations is amended as follows: 1) Nearly automatically qualifies a disaster county once it is categorized by the U.S. Drought Monitor as a severe drought for eight consecutive weeks during the growing season. Effective July 12, 1,016 primary counties in 26 states will be designated as natural disaster areas, making all qualified farm operators in the designated areas eligible for low interest emergency loans from USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA), provided eligibility requirements are met. 2) Streamlines the USDA Secretarial designation process, which is expected to provide better service to farmers and ranchers by reducing by approximately 40 percent the amount of time required for designating a disaster area. 3) Removes the requirement that a request for a disaster designation be initiated by a state governor or Indian tribal council, increasing the likelihood that counties will be covered. Indian tribal councils and governors may still submit a request for a designation, but it will not be required in order to initiate a disaster declaration. ...

In addition, it was a very dry winter with very little snow compared to other winters.  Our Spring had short grass and about half the quantity of stalks.  The bunch grass was completely dried by mid June, when usually it's not dry until mid July.  The other grasses had gone to seed before June, when usually they go to seed by mid to late June.  There seemed to be not as much pine pollen this year, and I have seen many many more bark beetles everywhere this year than in years past.  In fact, this is the first year in 12 years that I have lived in this area where I saw more than just one or two bark beetles.  This year I have seen hundereds of bark beetles caught inside of boxes and buckets and in cracks and crevaces, in the dry rain gauge, etc.  I'm hoping that I don't lose any pinions to the beetles.  I have noticed that very, very few wildflowers bloomed this year, including the penstemons, lupins, mariposa lilies, maracopa poppies, and california poppies.  In regards to insects: there are much fewer yellow jackets, sweat flies, spiders, june beetles, and moths.  I haven't seen any wasps either, not the tiny ones on the oaks, or the bigger ones.  I haven't seen a scorpion or a jerusalem cricket.  It still sounds like there's lots of crickets at night time.  The dry spell along with the unusually hot May and June probably contributed to the early seeding of the grasses.  I can't say about the birds, because I stopped feeding them this spring.  I can't afford it right now.  I haven't seen any reptiles at all this spring or summer.  Not a lizard or snake.  Every year we see lots of lizards and a few snakes, but not this year.  Not a single reptile.  Hope that comment doesn't conjure up a rattler now....  The burned out forest (Day Fire in '06) is now six years later but after this dry spring and summer, it looks like the fire just happened a year or two ago.  Most of the burned trees are still standing.  No woodpeckers or flickers this year.  The creek bed (Lockwood Creek that crosses over Boy Scout Camp Rd), hasn't had water flowing in it for months.  No thistle plants, when usually I have one or two dozen of them.   This means that there are no humming birds either.  It's a very dry, lean year for plants, animals, and people.  This year it seems that most life forms have it real tough.  A nice thing for me is the competition between McDonalds and Jack-in-the-Box offering $1 large soft drinks.  That makes long drives much more pleasant.  I'm very worried about fires.

30859,Number of mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus at an all-time high in California,09/15/2014,01/01/2012,12/31/2014,"Nearly 800 Californians were infected with the West Nile virus in 2014, the worst outbreak in a decade.  Drought was blamed for the record number of cases, and 2015 is expected to bring more of the same.  The virus is mainly spread by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds and transmit the virus to humans.  Many people suffer no ill effects from the virus, while others become extremely sick and even die.When the California drought began in 2012, the number of West Nile virus cases rose to 479 from 158 the previous year.  In 2014, 798 cases were recorded, the highest number since 2005, said the California Department of Public Health.  Twenty-nine people died.  Experts attribute the elevated West Nile activity to stagnant water and water sources in populated areas bringing the virus closer to people.  The virus activity was most intense in Southern California, and especially in Orange County where 266 human cases were reported and the highest rate of infected mosquitoes was found. Water conservation measures prevented the county from flushing its underground storm drains where mosquitoes flourished.  The Sacramento Bee (Calif.), Feb. 24, 2015The number of California mosquitoes infected with the West Nile virus has risen to record heights this year, according to the California Department of Public Health. Santa Clara County has been a hot spot for birds carrying the West Nile virus, with more than one-third of the total affected birds statewide being found there.  Health departments in Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties have been taking measures to reduce the number mosquitoes with the West Nile virus since mosquitoes transmit the disease to birds. The Santa Clara County Vector Control District found that 1 in 20 mosquitoes were infected with the West Nile virus this summer.  Eighty of Alameda County’s 92 West Nile-positive birds were found in Livermore, leading health officials to pull out the stops to eradicate the mosquitoes.Throughout California, there have been 562 human cases of West Nile reported through Oct. 21, more than twice the count at this time in 2013.  Seventeen deaths have been related to the virus since the start of the year, compared with 15 deaths in all of 2013.  Five human cases leading to the neural-invasive type of complication were confirmed in Contra Costa County.  A dozen people in Santa Clara County contracted the virus, with four being hospitalized also with neural-invasive complications.Public health officials say the uptick in West Nile virus cases could be attributed to climate, the number and types of birds and mosquitoes in an area, birds’ immune systems and drought.San Jose Mercury News (Calif.), Oct. 19, 2014The number of mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus was at an all-time high, said state health officials.  Since the start of the year, 181 cases of West Nile virus were reported to the California Department of Public Health, and eight people have died.  During the last week alone, 52 new cases were reported.  A state public health official said drought may be contributing to the spread of the virus via birds and mosquitoes.

The board first adopted the resolution declaring a local emergency on June 19, and they have re-authorized the declaration every two weeks since June 19.  The drought emergency remains in effect as of March 2, 2011 because one of the Kings County supervisors mistakenly pushed the wrong button during the vote to extend the measure.  He stated that he will vote differently on March 29 when the issue will be revisited.

40566,Many female tortoises died in California's Joshua Tree National Park,05/18/2017,05/17/2007,05/17/2017,"Numerous female desert tortoises have died in Southern California, and it seems that the creatures died trying to reproduce amid the recent drought.  The tortoises likely used up their water and energy to lay eggs.  Fewer males have died than females in the Joshua Tree National Park.  From the state of deterioration of the carcasses and chalkiness of the bones, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that the tortoises died within the last 5 to 10 years, which encompasses the past five years of intense drought.

In a 2018 report, the National Park Service stated that climate change, drought, invasive plants and certain activities, such as woodcutting and cattle grazing, have reduced the number of seedlings to replace older cactuses.  Seedlings and juvenile cactuses have been declining since the 1990s.AZ Central (Phoenix, Ariz.), June 18, 2020",Plants & Wildlife,"La Paz County, AZ, Maricopa County, AZ, Pima County, AZ, Pinal County, AZ, Santa Cruz County, AZ, Yuma County, AZ, Imperial County, CA, Riverside County, CA, San Bernardino County, CA",
29853,Drought was linked to a decrease in the desert tortoise population in a one square-mile study plot in Joshua Tree National Park in southern California,12/16/2013,01/01/1996,12/31/2012,"Drought was linked to a decrease in the desert tortoise population in a one square-mile study plot in Joshua Tree National Park, according to a study by the U.S. Geological Survey.  The tortoises were monitored from 1996 through 2012, during which there were periods of drought, and their numbers fell from 175 to 200 tortoises at the beginning of the study to about 25 tortoises at the end.  Two to three years of drought were observed to seriously compromise the tortoises’ survival.  Drought kills the annual plants, leading to a die-off of the rodents that eat the plants.  Then coyotes, which normally eat kangaroo rats and rabbits, begin eating tortoises, said the lead researcher of the USGS team.
