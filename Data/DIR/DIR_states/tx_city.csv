Residents have cut their water use by about half in the last year, according to the city’s water utility director, but the city needs more water.If approved, waste water will go through a four-step recycling process, blending effluent and reservoir water in equal parts, using a higher percentage of effluent than has been used in the past.

Troy Fraser and Sen. Kirk Watson sent a letter to the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), urging them not to release water to rice farmers.  The senators assert that giving water to the rice farmers would violate a court order and an agreement with the city of Austin.  The senators also intend to pursue legislation to prohibit future water releases for irrigation and would support legal action to prevent the LCRA from releasing the water to rice farmers in the spring.  The LCRA’s water management plan allows water releases for irrigation when lakes Travis and Buchanan are at 42 percent of capacity or greater, which is what the lakes hold as of Dec. 12.  If the state does not receive more rainfall next year than it did this year and rice farmers get irrigation water in 2013, the water left in lakes Travis and Buchanan may be about 33 percent in early 2014, according to some calculations.

In Port Lavaca, the effects of the closure of the oyster beds touched many businesses from gas stations to equipment suppliers to eating establishments where fishermen would be spending money, but without oysters and work, there is no demand for such things.   An oyster transport company in San Leon trucks only four to five loads of Louisiana oysters instead of the ten truckloads of that it used to ship daily.

New parks have only small patches of grass, while the grassy park outside of City Hall was turned into a garden of succulents.  Some L.A. residents feel that the mission to get rid of grass has deprived children of play spaces.  One woman stated, “It’s getting to the point where kids live in apartments, and they don’t even see grass, except in magazines.  I don’t want to end up like New York or Chicago, with no grass.”In July 2013, the rebate for replacing a square foot of grass rose from $2 to $2.50 in Los Angeles to encourage even more people to forego the grass.  The rebate in Long Beach increased to $3 per square foot.  In Las Vegas, Nevada  the front yards of new developments may not be planted with new grass, and medians on the Strip are covered with synthetic turf, not real grass.  The transition began in 2003 when the Las Vegas Valley Water District offered the nation’s first turf removal program and has since paid nearly $200 million for the removal of 165.6 million square feet of grass around homes and businesses.  Once the grass has been removed from a residential yard, the amount of the rebate plus interest must be paid back to the city before the owner can have a yard of grass again.
